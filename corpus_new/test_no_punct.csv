politics,talk.politics.guns,According to an Australian documentary made in the year before the stand off began Koresh and his followers all believed he was Christ Koresh had sex with children and women married to other men in the compound These were the perfect children resulting from the great seed of his magnified horn Ex-members describe him in ways not dissimilar to the way Jim Jones has been described I do n't know how accurate the documentary was however Koresh was never convicted of any crimes against children nor was the BATF after him for child abuse Their purview in this case is strictly in firearms violations so this information is irrelevant to the discussion FBI agents have to pass rigorous psychological examinations and background checks Plus those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain their decisions in great detail to congress Why would the FBI want to fulfill Koresh 's own prophecy Those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain something but whether their answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never know And who is left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled It only holds meaning for the nine who survived Correction The FBI said that two of the cult members said this so far no one else has been able to talk to them So when they talk to the news reporters directly and relate the same details will you believe them IF they confirm the story I probably will Definitely not until then however Mike Ruff

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Some of your article was cut off on the right margin but I will try and answer from what I can read Judaism did not father Islam We had many of the same prophets but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ who Christians and Muslims believe in and Mohammed The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples However note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion We are supposed to pay 6 of our income after all necessities are paid Please note that this 6 is on a personal basis if you are poor there is no need to pay quite the contrary this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world Also this money is not required in the human sense i.e a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid and we surely do n't pass money baskets around during our prayer services God 's presence is certainly on Earth but since God is everywhere God may show signs of existence in other places as well We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/ The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah Muslims believe that the Taurah the Bible and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message thus the many similiarities However the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated into other languages which has changed their meaning over time a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator s The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in Arabic Therefore we know that mankind has not changed its meaning It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother 's womb Only God knows for sure how it will turn out I hope it wo n't but if that happens it was the will of God Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what you said And yes may God help us all

science,sci.space,A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland on April 21 At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright luminous pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near Mikkeli The head of the pillar was circular The lower part was a little winding It was like a monster they told They were little frightened Soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon At last the light landed behind the nearby forest Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in Lappeenranta At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont The altitude of the trail was only about 3-4 degrees Soon the trail began to grow taller A loop was appeared in the head of the trail It was like a spoon This lasted only 10 seconds Now the altitude was about five degress above horizont He noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop The spot was at magnitude -2 The loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont Luminous trails were still visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket I do n't know if there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near Arkhangelsk but this may be a rocket experiment too Since 1969 we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland Most of these are rocket experiments military missile tests barium experiments and other chemical releases During these years we have observed 17 satellite launches Leo Wikholm

computer,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,From article C68uBG.K2w world.std.com by cfw world.std.com Christopher F Wroten Good question Answer The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA 's 8/ 16 But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus I think that 's either 8 or 10 mhz The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA but they move the data at the cpu speed up to 40 mhz So on a 33mhz cpu the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33 mhz and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on a 33 mhz cpu EISA should be about two maybe 3 times as fast as ISA That 's a very good question The EISA bus does have more advantages over the ISA bus than just it 's width For example more/better interrupts and bus mastering But these other factors do not impact a video card very much They have more impact on file servers with multiple hard drives full-throttle network cards cd-roms etc

politics,talk.politics.guns,Note These trial updates are summarized from reports in the _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station KTVB Channel 7 Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update Day 4 Friday April 16 1993 was the fourth day of the trial Synopsis Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence Although Spence has not explicitly stated so one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper Cooper is the government 's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan Spence attacked Cooper 's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper 's statements last September and those made in court Cooper conceded that You have all these things compressed into a few seconds It 's difficult to remember what went on first Cooper acknowledged that he carried a 9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver 's dog When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down Spence continued by asking with how many agents and to what extent had Cooper discussed last August 's events Cooper responded If you 're implying that we got our story together you 're wrong counselor Spence continued to advance the defense 's version of the events Namely that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver 's dog Cooper disagreed Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time Howen also complained that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense 's version of the events U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections however both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys I 'm not going to play games with either counsel This has been a personality problem from day 1 so start acting like professionals Spence told the judge that When all the evidence is in we 'll see that his agent Larry Cooper testimony is not credible that he was panicked and can not remember the sequence of events Spence continued We 're going to find that there is a very unlikely similarity almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen 's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial We ca n't have a fair trial if the jury believes I 'm some sort of charlatan if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was preposterous and denied the motion for a mistrial Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton The prosecution 's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence However the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper 's credibility Defense attorney Ellison Matthews Harris other attorney questioned Rampton about the dog Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver 's dog without being detected Matthews then had Rampton read a Septtember 15 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected if the dog chased them Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that but he could not remember when He then stated that I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted

religion,talk.religion.misc,"Looking at 1 we find that during Roman times Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop eventually with 14 dioceses under it that the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia was the basilica built in Tyre ca 314 that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware wine white marble and dyed cloth that Tyre along with other seaports provided outlets for South Arabian Indian and even Chinese trade that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by following a perpendicular rather than horizontal line of growth because it was running out of land to build on that Tyre established colonies of its own None of this sounds like a small fishing village by any stretch of the imagination Centuries later under the Abbasids Tyre had opulent and flourishing bazaars and buildings of 5-6 stories During this period Tyre was noted for its export of sugar beads and as of old glassware During the Crusades Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks There is a lot more but I got tired of writing In 2 we read the following description of modern Lebanon other major cities in Lebanon include Tripoli Sidon Tyre Baalbek and Zahlah my emphasis This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli military actions 1978 1982 on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984 Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present why is it always called a city or above a major city Why does it show up on all the maps When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list even if the list is only a dozen cities long 1 Philip K. Hitti _Lebanon in History From the earliest times to the present_ NY St. Martins 1967 2 Federal Research Division Library of Congress _Lebanon a country study_ edited by Thomas Collelo 1989 A one-horse town Sounds like a lot of work for one horse Anyway Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland They may even use cars these days The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says Pop 1982 est 23,000 Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000 the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut also so I doubt that it is a typo Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas I do n't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades In particular the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed Do n't most if not all of these apply not just to Tyre but to the other cities in the area Sidon for example Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids From 2 Tyre receiv ed the rights of autonomy from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy ed complete autonomy She started a large series of coins occasionally in gold The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans do n't seem to fit your characterization either And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low He happens to quote the same source you quote Nina Jidejian _Tyre through the Ages_ Beirut Dar El-Mashreq Publishers 1969 The same sentence in fact He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using an argument that I have n't seen in print anywhere else which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh I tried to find the Jidejian book but it is n't listed in Books in Print Can you tell me more about it Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I 've read I 'm curious to know why"

politics,talk.politics.guns,From article 1r19l9 7dv usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu by oldham ces.cwru.edu Daniel Oldham They did have the proper equipment The problem is that they went about things the wrong way The ATF should have served the warrant in a peacable manner instead of going in there like a bunch of Rambos with guns blazing I 'm not trying to excuse what David Koresh did I'm just saying that the ATF henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops went about the raid in an improper manner Let the FBI Customs and local police officers do the ATF 's job WE DO N'T NEED THEM ANYMORE The cigarette cops are just leftovers from Prohibition days They are an anachronism Including you What if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and cut you in half with a machine gun THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN Maybe they get the wrong address and then raid your home for example It 's happened before and it can happen again I have heard of more than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour Just recently I heard about a case in which police raided this guy 's home because they thought he had dope or something The guy blew both of the officers away and he did n't go to jail for it The judge hearing the case ruled that the man was acting in self-defense Are you sure that that would have been the way to go Surely the FBI and ATF could have handled this fiasco better They did n't have to massacre all those people As Stimpy said in Fake Dad Shame shame double shame The FBI and ATF should be ashamed of theirselves Scott Kennedy Brewer and Patriot

miscellaneous,misc.forsale,PC Game For Sale Waxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade 5.25 30 By the same folks who brought you Elvira I II I played Elvira I II and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive The first two games especially Elvira II Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult This is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park but it is quite fair in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy In one of the four wax works to be explored there is no fighting at all well almost none though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate RPGs one for each of the four exhibits you must enter In starting each one your character is transported with no objects to use and experience level 1 One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting mapping and puzzle solving Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans kill the head plant alien and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim and of course the police think you are responsible You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and meet him face to face but first get a disquise The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game as was the case for the Elvira games though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans All prices include shipping All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated US buyers only please All games will be shipped inside a box with packing insured priority USPS All games include all original materials including box manual disks and registration unless otherwise noted The first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to get the game Those just asking questions get no priority until they offer to buy the game Lower offers may be considered assuming no other offers at asking price are made

experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT I decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 1987 model years I narrowed it down to those two I liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a Porsche The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924 I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924 but i decided to stop by my insurance agent 's office on the way I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car If you buy the Supra your rate classification will be the same as the Celica the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account If you buy the Porsche 924 we 'll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double And if you go with a 944 it 's another story again we 'll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that But the Supra is much faster than the 924 and the 924 is actually faster than the standard 944 That doens't make sense That 's what the book says We do n't insure Corvettes either For some reason the underwriters consider Supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room At equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche plus its higher insurance I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft Everyone 's entitled to MY opinion goldberg oasys.dt.navy.mil is more important than knowledge Albert 32 I live in Idaho When I was 26 many years ago 10 years I bought a Trans Am new Insurance was about 1300/year When I turned 26 it immediately dropped to 460/year I had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age

politics,talk.politics.misc,Of course one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government power and keeps it circumscribed in a complex society when it is in the interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using government power for their own ends But apart from that little conundrum Without having a complete answer to this question I should think it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be a desirable result There are still quite a lot of people who feel that the command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than essential weaknesses of caommand economies and you still have a majority in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on the books in order to send a signal It would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented Now why do you suppose that never seems to occur I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place Constant combat is n't particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing Also they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable society anyway I would n't call it vague I 'd call it elastic All regulation is not necessarily the same By opposing all government regulation some libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that regulate relatively free markets as identical That 's one reason many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic Umm is there any distinction between vague and elastic in this context aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other At any rate we 've been through all this before Steve Hendricks DOMAIN steveh thor.ISC-BR.COM One thing about data it sure does cut| UUCP uunet isc-br thor steveh the bulls t.

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,quoted for future reference He believed one of two things 1 Sabo was more likely than Samuel to get a hit OR 2 that more good would be done in the long run by leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome In fact you do n't know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in In fact I do n't think anyone is claiming that they can predict the future or any particular future event But we can believe that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have identified the cause and therefore will continue I think seeing insults in other people 's opinions is kind of silly After all Mark did n't call you a total idiot or call your work stupid he simply stated that it did n't change his opinion on the subject If player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has and Mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next season as well would you respond the same way At some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows what this guy does every Monday night Maybe he sees his sports shrink on Tuesday mornings or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights But this is something that 's true of one guy only It doesn't mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week nor that there should be But it doesn't mean we ca n't make predictions based on that for that particular player I only see a prediction for one player here I do n't see anything about ALL batters That 's exactly what Mark is trying to do though Find hitters that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions for these hitters based on their past performance Huh What does gambler 's fallacy have to do with anything Whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you can't deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that you do n't think it is likely to continue to exist because you ca n't see a reason for it to exist Someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate The argument along the lines of star player with L/R splits will always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game i.e opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to face him where his manager will not pull him for a PH What about you If the shoe fits will you wear it with an open mind

science,sci.electronics,While it 's possible that it 's a ham radio transmitter that you're hearing it is n't likely every bit of signal that does n't go out the antenna is wasted as far as a ham is concerned and most hams are It is the radiated signal that would cause the problem technically competent to ensure that they do n't waste any signal if they can possibly avoid it To get their ham license they had to pass a government exam that tests them on that point among others However you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure there are lots of other services where the operators ARE N'T required to be technically competent Citizens Band CB for example There is nothing in the Amateur Radio Tests that requires an technical competence at all It is a simple matter to memorize all the questions and answers However that said most Hams that I know do spend quite a bit of time gaining some technical skill Listen to the interference If you hear voices clearly it almost certainly IS N'T ham radio and might well be CB If you can record a Do n't count on that bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator 's house and ask him for his opinion of what you 're hearing Most communities You can not do that legally However you can ask a ham over to listen If the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such scheduling If nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes If he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing to help you resolve interference complaints Look in the phone book or ask at the local ham radio store or call the FCC for contact info The FCC may or may not have such information They have enough to do without getting calls for such information If nothing else call your city offices or police department general business number They should have the name of a local ham contact If it 's a ham he 's more than likely willing to help get rid of the problem After all it would be his signal he 's wasting If it is n't the interference committee or the FCC may be able to suggest solutions See above your concept of wasted signal is erroneous If his rig is transmitting properly then the chance of interference with the exception of harmonic television interference is the greatest since he is putting out the strongest signal It is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a piece of consumer audio or TV equipment just because the manufacturer of the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device that would n't affect one person in a thousand but which bites you Often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable person perhaps even the person operating the transmitter you're hearing Unfortunately most consumer equipment is succeptable it is all poorly designed BTW hams are ALLOWED amplifiers CB is n't illegal ham amplifier does n't compute It does but not for a mobile radio There are very few mobile rigs that could power a 1500 watt amplifier

science,sci.med,Both of these symptoms are related tachycardia Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood since note sodium chloride monosodium glutamate Both are sodium compounds Our bodies require sodium but like everything else one can get too much of a good thing Again this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate from the sodium in the MSG Distended crainial arteries essentially One of many causes of headaches There is no discrepency her necessarily Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related Again not necessarily a discrepency More likely a related reaction Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten If a person ca n't digest the stuff entirely possible the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long and lacks an enzyme to break it down gastrointestinal distress stomach or belly ache would be expected These are respiratory reactions and are now considered to be similar to vomitting They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds They are adaptiove responses Of course it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms But it 's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive synergystic subtractive etc etc It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish and what else the person was exposed to Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT resopiration and heart rate are connected Things in the body are far from simple very inetractive place the vertebrate body People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound It depends upon what it is about the compound that pisses off their body Pollen for example of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people because when inhaled it sets of the immune system and an histamine attack is launched The immune system goes overboard causing the allergic person a lot of misery And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens Chamomile linden etc Drinking the substance can perturb that person 's system as much as inhaling it See above And do n't think that heart rate changes and circulatory problems are not serious They can be deadly and brain damage The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol as well as somatostatin and other steroids Testing for effective dose would be uh a wee bit unethical poisoning Absolutely But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating say undetected shrimp or mushrooms to which many are allergic plus too much alcohol and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home plus let 's say having contracted flu from one 's sig other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass Could be all sorts of things But it might be the MSG If noone else got sick its likely not food poisoning Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy 's allergic to Anyway the human body 's not a machine people vary widely in their responses and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things

science,sci.crypt,specific objections that do n't sound frighteningly technical
science,sci.med,No one else seems to know so I 'll post this This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started As I recall its been done to some experimental mice They showed various ill effects and eventually died The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass which causes lower velocity Boltzman constant mumble This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter and you get sick and die I 've never heard of anyone being poisened this way in or out of real life The process takes quite a while If anyone wants to write this book I would imagine you would have to 1 Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water 2 Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here Come to think of it 2 would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested so hospitalisation might be too late The most detectable effect would be that the victim 's body fluids would literally be heavy Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20 Thus the victim 's weight will increase by about 1 for every 10 of body water replaced by heavy water Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim 's urine is strangely dense Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid Paul
science,sci.crypt,I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too But of course I knew that because it is so easy to do There is not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the colligation of data about Maybe your name is here Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator Minutes followup comments to other participants and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use of the people who attended Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons First it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group late and who might like to easily read earlier posts second traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled three a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such keys it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William Sessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it collected for them
politics,talk.politics.misc,The median of a distribution is that variate-value which divides the distribution halfway i.e 1/2 of the distribution population have lower and half have higher variate-values So for Males 20-39 the median=7.3 this means that half of these men are higher than this and half are lower than this Now if the population sample size is 3300 and 1 of them are gay 33 males are gay If we say they are distributed equally then only 16.5 are greater than 7.3 sexual partners of course this means that 49.5 heterosexual men are greater than 7.3 Not quite First the median does not imply that half of the men are above and half below 7.3 it simply means that 7.3 is the mid-point between the maximum number of partners and the minimum which is most likely zero However assuming your implication to be more-or-less correct your final result is still invalid If 50 of all males have had more than 7.3 partners and you deduct the assumed 1 of homosexual males what remains is not 49.5 but still 50 of all heterosexual males Which is to say hey we 're all human

recreation,rec.sport.hockey,Bleep Bleep Bleep The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T I ca n't stand it Aside from frustrated ravings I must give Buffalo credit they are making good on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense Boston players ca n't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he 's also getting plenty of help Boston has been playing rather well better than would be indicated by the series score of 3-0 but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game As a result Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single game the outlook for the Bruin 's advancement to the second round are quite bleak IMHO the Bruins NEED to score first If they can do that they have an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 2nd and 3rd periods The scary thing is that I 'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year I 'll never cheer for the Sabres You ca n't convert me MTM3
science,sci.med,Recurrent Volvulus This is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy has been suffering from ever since he was an infant He had a surgery when he was one year old Another surgery had to be performed one year after when he was two years old He turned three this February and he is still getting afflicted by this illness like having to get hospitalised for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed not having a third surgery so far One thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction peaks around the time he was born on nearabouts like in March every year Any significance to this Why does this recur Me and my family go through severe pain when our little boy have to undergo surgery Why does surgery not rectify the situation Also which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of recurrence As time goes on will the probability of recurrence go down considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably less prone to attacks Or is this assumption wrong Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated Thanks very much

computer,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,I hope this will clear it up Taken from one of my lecture notes The alternative approach to CISC which has been adopted by many in recent years has come to be known as RISC the Reduced Instruction Set Computer This can be characterised simply as Simpler is Faster by simplifying the design e.g by reducing the variety of instructions addressing modes the hardware can be designed to run faster Even at the cost of needing more instructions the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler faster design A typical RISC processor will o provide a large number of registers e.g 32 o perform all data operations on registers o provide few addressing modes e.g immediate or 'register offset o only allow load store operations to access memory o only use a few instruction formats o only support a few data types e.g integer unsigned floating

player CD Caddies HD floppy disks any used Macintosh software a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor or basically anything you have lying around cans of soup the neighbor 's cat etc Make me an offer no offer will be overlooked I really want to get rid of this stuff Ok Here 's the list 52 Meg 3.5 SCSI Hard Drive Conner Model CP-3150 I bought this from a guy at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh Unfortunately I ca n't seem to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer The guy tested it with his PC and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors I 'll send you a copy I was dumb enough not to get his phone number so I ca n't return it to him The drive has many jumpers on it which I do n't know how to set so maybe that 's the problem I was quite disappointed that it didn't work so I 'm trying to minimize my losses 45 52 Meg 3.5 SCSI Hard Drive Conner Model CP-3150 Same situation as above I bought both of these drives from the same guy Despite the different model numbers they are the same exact drive Same report from NDD I have one for each drive will be included 45 40 Meg SONY 3.5 SCSI Hard Drive SONY Model SRD2040A The drive mechanism is completely trashed This hard drive was in my computer Mac SE and had a stiction problem Well repeated banging on the side of the computer resulted in a head crash yes metal scraping metal which was not too pleasant to listen to Still the SCSI controller card is in good working order and can be used for parts or a project 20 65 Meg Seagate 5.25 HH SCSI Hard Drive Model ST-277N I originally bought this drive because it had a small stiction problem and I though that I could fix it Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine and that it was a controller problem motor controller was n't sending proper signals Well after taking the controller off the drive looking at it and putting it back together I realized that I accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the controller I tried to solder it but I 'm not that good at soldering so I could n't do it Worked perfectly before I messed up I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY above crashed on me Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications worth well over 1000 Claris CAD MS Word 5.0 Think C Excel and many others I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable You also get all the software on the drive if you can accept being a pirate I only ask that you delete my data files from the drive I was really angry when I broke that connection and then could n't fix it I just do n't have time to play with it any more 65 AT T ISDN 7500 Modem This is for use on digital phone systems If you know what this is or would like technical information on it let me know I have some tech documents on it Is supposed to be the same thing as an AT T digital phone but without the phone part It seems to be in working order passes self test perfectly OK I have no idea how this is worth Let me know if you 're interested Motorola 68881 CoProcessor I have n't tested this one out yet but if anyone is interested I will get it tested out to make sure that it works I had trouble using it with my accelerator board but then I spoke to the manufacturer of the board and found out it could n't be used without another controller chip When I was looking around to buy one new the prices were

DICK Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels His stories are bizarre at times but very approachable He wrote mainly SF but he wrote about people truth and religion rather than technology Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God he remained sceptical Amongst his novels the following are of some relevance Galactic Pot-Healer A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply A polished ironic and amusing novel A Maze of Death Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion VALIS The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters The Divine Invasion God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system Unfortunately she is terminally ill and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music MARGARET ATWOOD The Handmaid 's Tale A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it right again The book is the diary of a woman 's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy Women 's right to own property is revoked and their bank accounts are closed sinful luxuries are outlawed and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible Crimes are punished retroactively doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are hunted down and hanged Atwood 's writing style is difficult to get used to at first but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on VARIOUS AUTHORS The Bible This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized However it is probably worth reading if only so that you 'll know what all the fuss is about It exists in many different versions so make sure you get the one true version Books Non-fiction PETER DE ROSA Vicars of Christ Bantam Press 1988 Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very enlighting history of papal immoralities adulteries fallacies etc German translation Gottes erste Diener Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums Droemer-Knaur 1989 MICHAEL MARTIN Atheism A Philosophical Justification Temple University Press Philadelphia USA A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this necessarily tendentious area Argues both for negative atheism i.e the non-belief in the existence of god s and also for positive atheism the belief in the non-existence of god s Includes great refutations of the most challenging arguments for god particular attention is paid to refuting contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne 541 pages ISBN 0-87722-642-3 hardcover paperback also available The Case Against Christianity Temple University Press A comprehensive critique of Christianity in which he considers the best contemporary defences of Christianity and ultimately demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent 273 pages ISBN 0-87722-767-5 JAMES TURNER Without God Without Creed The Johns Hopkins University Press Baltimore MD USA Subtitled The Origins of Unbelief in America Examines the way in which unbelief whether agnostic or atheistic became a mainstream alternative world-view Focusses on the period 1770-1900 and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American and particularly New England developments Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism Without God Without Creed is rather the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea the belief that God exists 316 pages ISBN hardcover 0-8018-2494-X paper 0-8018-3407-4 GEORGE SELDES Editor The great thoughts Ballantine Books New York USA A dictionary of quotations of a different kind concentrating on statements and writings which explicitly or implicitly present the person 's philosophy and world-view Includes obscure and often suppressed opinions from many people For some popular observations traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff 's What Great Men Think of Religion and Noyes Views of Religion 490 pages ISBN paper 0-345-29887-X RICHARD SWINBURNE The Existence of God Revised Edition Clarendon Paperbacks Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of Theism 1977 and was concluded with Faith and Reason 1981 In this work Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God His arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in Mackie 's The Miracle of Theism In the revised edition of The Existence of God Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie J. L. MACKIE The Miracle of Theism Oxford This posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes Anselm Berkeley Hume et al through the moral arguments of Newman Kant and Sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational such as those of Kierkegaard Kung and Philips as well as replacements for God such as Lelie 's axiarchism The book is a delight to read less formalistic and better written than Martin 's works and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne JAMES A.

politics,talk.politics.guns,Here is a press release from the White House President Clinton 's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To National Desk Contact White House Office of the Press Secretary 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON April 20 /U.S Newswire/ Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press Part 2 of 2 Go ahead Sarah Q There are two questions I want to ask you The first is I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did so the children had no chance because this gas was very she said it was not lethal but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks And on February 28th let 's go back didn't those people have a right to practice their religion THE PRESIDENT They were not just practicing their religion they were the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws any number of them Q What federal laws THE PRESIDENT Let me go back and answer I can't answer the question about the gas masks except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested they were convinced that it would n't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside And one of the things that I 've heard I do n't want to get into the details of this because I do n't know but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it did n't have the desired effect They also knew Sarah that there was an underground compound a bus buried underground where the children could be sent And they were I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected In terms of the gas masks themselves I learned yesterday I did not ask this fact question before that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance MS. MYERS Last question Q Mr. President why are you still saying that Q Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments THE PRESIDENT What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen And she said and of course the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public he had that had been debated anyway And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future That was the judgment they made Whether they were right or wrong of course we will never know What happened when I saw the fire when I saw the building burning I was sick I felt terrible And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside trying to burn themselves up That 's the first thing I wanted to know Thank you Q Mr. President why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision Is n't it in the end your decision THE PRESIDENT Well what I 'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour detailed briefing from the FBI I didn't go over every strategic part of it It is a decision for which I take responsibility I 'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call When I talked to her on Sunday some time had elapsed She might have made a decision to change her mind I said if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow I will support you And I do support her She is not ultimately responsible to the American people I am But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have Thank you Applause

religion,soc.religion.christian,I seldom see any posts in this group Is anyone out there in Christendom listening If so why do n't we get some dialog going here Here 's a topic to get things started My daughter 's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics This week they sent something very interesting It was an article written by the leader of a national US Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem While there he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen Brothers and sisters the time is at hand Our redemption is drawing near Look up

religion,soc.religion.christian,Sure why not But are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus So anyone who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches others the same way will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies whereas anyone who keeps the commands and teaches them too will be known as someone great in the kingdom of the skies Mat5:19 Gaus Are you an anyone or are you a no one Why not assume that since Jesus did n't say that his words apply only to Jews that they apply to all human beings irregardless of race or sex Why not assume that even though Jesus did not mention your name still Jesus was talking directly to you Does it say that it applies to you Are you anyone or no one Ex20:8-11 JPS Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy Six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God you shall not do any work you your son or daughter your male or female slave or your cattle or the stranger who is within your settlements For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them and He rested on the seventh day therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it Note There is no specific requirement for worship here however I for one would not be so bold as to call these verses a ceremonial detail Do n't many Christians still practice circumcision It 's unfortunate that Jesus did n't use your name directly or maybe Jesus did Are you somebody or nobody If you do n't see a problem then perhaps there is none As Paul closes Romans 14 Gaus In short pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up Do n't let dietary considerations undo the work of God Everything may be clean but it 's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by As for the faith that you have keep that between yourself and God The person is in luck who does n't condemn himself for what he samples On the other hand the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty because he is n't acting on his faith and any failure to act on faith is a sin

religion,soc.religion.christian,which Kenneth Engel challenges I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of Jesus paying for our sins in the sense that many Christians accept as literal The point is that God understands the suffering we go through not just intellectually like when we watch the Somalians on TV but _really_ understands He can feel our pain This fact is manifested by Jesus life We can argue that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion we can think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to worse despair but the main point is that Jesus is in the trenches with us He is in everyone whatever I do to the least of humanity I do to Him and whatever I do for the least of humanity I do for Him Now to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my capabilities but that was n't my goal Thankfully our moderator is surprising As I re-read this I must admit that this is more of a description of my faith than an explanation but perhaps that 's all I can do hopefully that 's all I have to do

politics,talk.politics.mideast,This issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of just one reference probably wo n't resolve this issue to those that oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed Even in your location of this one reference you spend most of your quote dealing with an incidence that while abhorrant has nothing to do with the issue at hand here Then at the end of the quote there is an almost off-hand comment that two mosques were destroyed To support a claim of this nature what other authors support this incident If identifiable mosques were destroyed they are certainly identifiable they have names and addresses steet location The comment by one reporter does make us wonder if this happened but by no means proves it There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall That does not mean however that once can generalize from this to any other points The entire plaza mosques and all was cleared to make it possible for Jews to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of them and which had been denied to them for millenia On the other hand throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel to the best of my knowledge Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided damage to any Islamic religious sites This contrasts with the policies of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and bigotry Or for that matter with the USA Around here nobody reroutes freeways to avoid churches synagogues and so forth They just get condemned paid off and the road goes through The same is standard policy for any number of other public projects schools and sports arenas being only two examples Anticipating the objection that the cases are n't comparable how not The Wall has to count as the 1 tourist attraction in that part of the world making room for the traffic would be a twenty second decision for any city council I ever heard of
recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Amusing is n't it Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a team game combining efforts from every player for the win Consider the Red Sox game last night The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th Who won the game -Clemens pitched a strong nine innings allowing only two runs -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings gave up the go-ahead run and got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of the inning Looks like a team effort to me Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win How about the offense -Dawson and Vaughn hit I think HRs early in the game Without either one the Sox would have lost in nine -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana providing the speed to go from first to third when -Cooper ripped a second single in the inning -Melvin avoided the DP getting the run home with a sac fly Not much of a help but it was something -Scrub Richardson then hit a double scoring the speedy Cooper all the way from first Hill 's lack of defense helped Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs But it seems to me that it was Quintana 's hit that set up the whole inning And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson Furthermore people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner and moved the tying run to third base with only one out Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous You can argue that OBP and SLG do n't show you who came through in the clutch but R RBI do n't do any better At least OBP and SLG don't claim to try to tell you that Here 's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night 's victory All 20 of them

science,sci.med,"There 's a lot of evidence it just has n't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote or 'empirical is used For example Dr. Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives before any other treatment a systemic anti-fungal such as Nizoral to his new patients IF they 've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years He 's kept a record of the results and for over 2000 patients found that over 90 of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms Of course this is only the beginning for his program In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection I agree it is a poorly written book e.g. extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which I never had before started in November Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes I 'm also greatly improved in other areas as well Of course I have allergy symptoms etc I am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms Also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people In my case it was sinus since that 's the center of my allergic response Of course the 60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis Fortunately Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals still have to be careful however so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons BTW some would say to try Nystatin Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect You 'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who have n't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients If anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection I can not guarantee their safety For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am concerned Jon Noring Charter Member INFJ Club"

James Weaver D Ore asked Watt whether you agree that we should save some of our scenic resources for our children not just gobble them up all at once Watt's answer was Absolutely That is the delicate balance the Secretary of the Interior must have to be steward for the natural resources for this generation as well as future generations I do not know how many future generations we can count on before the Lord returns Whatever it is we have to manage with a skill to have the resources needed for future generations My source is a column by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak on the op-ed page of the WASHINGTON POST for Friday 21 August 1981

politics,talk.politics.mideast,"From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Symbiotics Zionism-Antisemitism Zionism and the Holocaust by Haim Bresheeth The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti-semitism is impossible Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism namely that Jews can not live with non- Jews The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942 its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence The socialist Bund a mass movement with enormous following had to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political Zionists In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe 's workers the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state Historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle History can be seen as an option tree every time a certain option is chosen other routes become barred Because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich The Zionist Federation of Germany ZVfD an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period From a marginal position the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them All of a sudden they attained political power power based not on representation but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in Germany and some other countries in Europe into a real option to be considered by German Jews The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement of 1934 Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933 Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out the campaign would collapse This problem was solved by the ZVfD A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21 June 1933 outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race nation and the nature of the 'Jewish problem and it offered to collaborate with the new regime The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development Boycott propaganda such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways is in essence unZionist because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott The main public act was the signature of the Transfer Agreement with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934 In essence the agreement was designed to get Germany 's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of German goods to Palestine This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination The Zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial organisations This agreement operated on a number of fronts 'helping Jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the boycott exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the Jews After all they argued the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them After news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary Baron Von Mildenstein the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS later followed by Eichmann was invited to travel to Palestine This he did in early 1933 in the company of a Zionist leader Kurt Tuchler Having spent six months in Palestine he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew of Zionism a Jew Nazis could accept and understand This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism between the new regime and the ZVfD a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust by S. B. Beth-Zvi In the case of the Kastner episode around which Jim Allen 's play PERDITION is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist It occured near the end of the war The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany Italy and the African bases had been lost The Nazis were on the run with a number of key countries such as Rumania leaving the Axis A second front was a matter of months away as the western Allies prepared their forces In the midst of all this we find Eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest after the German takeover of the country in April 1944 His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership and to appoint Zionist Federation members headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities Why they did this is not difficult to see As opposed to Poland where its three and a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community The middle class was mainly Jewish the Jews were mainly middle-class They enjoyed freedom of travel served in the Hungarian fascist army in fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were Hungarian how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated The task was not easy there were a million Jews in Hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other countries Many had heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials Like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members Without their help the SS with 19 officers and less than 90 men plus a few hundred Hungarian police could not have collected and controlled a million Jews when they did not even know their whereabouts Kastner and the others were left under no illusions Eichmann told Joel Brand one of the members of Kastner's committee that he intended to send all Hungary 's Jews to Auschwitz before he even started the expulsions He told them clearly that all these Jews will die 12,000 a day unless certain conditions were met The Committee faced a simple choice to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate with neutral Rumania where many could escape being in most cases a few hours away or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process What would not have been believed when coming from the SS sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership Thus it is that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps To be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction the trains of 'prominents which Eichmann promised to Kastner a promise he kept to the last detail For Eichmann it was a bargain allowing 1,680 Jews to survive as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration like say Rumkovsky in Lodz Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs Palgi and Senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operations At no point during his trial or elsewhere did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews"

Scott declaimed Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN They love a winner and will not tolerate a loser And so on The political implications are simple If as many socialists and Democrats do you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some equitable way then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on That could be black women today Asian homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that 39 minority Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say as do most conservatives and all the libertarians and act is if you did n't care who 's winning and who 's losing In some cases you might say something about make sure the game is fair equality of opportunity not of condition In the latter case you might be able to identify yourself as a neoconservative or a neoliberal depending on how much you want to limit the pot Either way you go the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular at least after you graduate from High School but you 'll still be popular at High School reunions But it beats being a Nerd as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree and in the long run it is the only way to go Even in Hollywood which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington D.C. and even in Columbus Ohio which produced Alex Keaton but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties I 'd like to see more Winners in this society regardless of race gender religious preference and sexual orientation Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl someday Bill R.

science,sci.space,What evidence indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speaking indicates we 're seeing an edge to the distribution Given the enormous power i was just wondering what if they are quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by Why would they have to be at galactic ranges Now in the good old days before GRO data it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population within a few hundred light years or that they were in the galactic halo Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC suggesting theorists might be wrong back then As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then gets large the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable and we should start to see for example the Andromeda 's bursters The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum Or it can be a cosmological distances hence isotropy and the edge is the edge of the Universe If at cosmological distances you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole Even then getting the spectrum is very hard but conceivable If we know anything about physics at that level the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings wrong spectrum for one thing The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources in the colliding NS they 'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively my own pet theory is that it 's Flying saucers entering hyperspace but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in If you can think of one remember to invite me to Stockholm

science,sci.electronics,Except for their size the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890 's a hundred years ago for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways Basicly the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower To assist cooling and the draft water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes The cold water evaporates removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers That slight pinch maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced compared to a straight cylinder shape The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage hot turbine to final stage cold turbine R.

politics,talk.politics.guns,If in said situation I would reviewing other cases I 've seen reported on in the articles I 've read etc suggest the safest legal course of action is as follows Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a weapon Yes Even though it 's blatantly obvious now that you have it out and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile action he is currently involved in ie Drop the knife or I 'll shoot Repeat this process three times if you can not if he 's pointing a freaking gun at you himself That 's kinda impractical There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn After said warning considering it's ignored Aim center mass and fire until he drops This is not sadism it's practicality.If he has n't gone down he 's still a threat Why I support .45 IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK SHOT 'S FIRED IN ANGER WILL BURN YOU LATER Though in some cases the I can see where that might not bother me all that much If you do drop him REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE Have a Bystander or witness Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs call the police and wait Reholster your weapon VISIBLY Or place it on the ground nearby Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will use it 's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses Mentally mark witnesses If the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw Attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required how the hell can I phrase this Try to avoid special purpose ammunition Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone The only special purpose rounds that I can think of that would actually help your case as it has in several is the Glaser Safety Slug oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG The stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court ie Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate not ricochette and which is designed to STOP Not Kill Gee to bad the two often cross damn I 'm real sorry that rapist is dead NOT an assailant with one shot This again can be a real life saver in a hostile court Be as cooperative with the police as possible Show them where you were Repeat your information as often as requested They will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts and unfortunately to see if your lying Fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits BOOO Down with registered citizens Register your politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated If they are required in your state Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed If you can not afford one contact the NRA They have a legal assistance fund Or at least they used to I DO HOPE YOUR A MEMBER Not my business either way though If I was vague on anything or I left some questions unanswered you can E-MAIL me or post here Preferebly E-MAIL I do n't have a load of time to review the news Kane

science,sci.med,Where are your references I have been unable to find studies that state that chromium cures diabetese It can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take High blood pressure I have never heard of this claim before anabolic steroids I have also never heard of this claim before Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for God knows what reason Did somebody piss you off at one time I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself is n't likely to make a fat person thin But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health It is important to exercise 11 12 and also avoid fat calories 9 10 Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle 1 2 3 I will not bore you with the statistics You would n't believe these anyway Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium Chromium plays a vital role in sensitizing the body 's tissues to the hormone insulin Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus in turn makes it harder to lose weight 4 Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles 5 6 This protein sparing effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue By sensitizing muscle to insulin chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they burn more fat and less muscle Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate helping dieters keep off the fat they 've lost Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic heat producing effects of insulin Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories so it 's not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism 4 7 8 Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism In summary you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy A Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20 of calories Eating fat makes you fat B Increase dietary fiber low in calories high in nutrients C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week burn calories D. Take chromium picolinate daily lose fat keep muscle References 1 Kaats GR Fisher JA Blum K.

science,sci.crypt,"WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE by Robin Hanson Draft April 21 1993 SUMMARY Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police So the proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part in three thousand to be cost-effective BACKGROUND Until now phones have happened to allow the existence of wiretaps detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line And over time law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to aid in criminal investigations However powerful new encryption technologies threaten this status quo by making possible truly private communication A small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphones at either end In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap phone conversations the U.S. government announced on April 16 1993 that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special wiretap chip to be placed in future phones instead of the total privacy chips which have been under private development The same day AT T announced it would use these chips in all its secure telephone products Each chip would be created under government supervision when it would be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key Periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast its identifier and other info in a special law enforcement block Law enforcement officers with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the indentifier from special trust agencies and could thereby listen in on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone To date most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its security The government wo n't disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it has claimed The track record of previous governments does not inspire confidence on this point 1 However this paper will neglect these concerns and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation That is which is a cheaper way for society to investigate crime force phone communications to support wiretaps or give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways Or to put it another way would police agencies be willing to pay for each wiretap if they had to pay their share of the full social cost of forcing phones to support wiretaps To start to answer this question we might compare the current benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan And since current benefits are easier to estimate we begin there WIRETAP BENEFITS 1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available 2 In that year 872 wiretap installations were requested and no requests were denied This figure does not include wiretaps obtained with the consent of a party to the conversation 2057 arrests resulted from wiretaps started the same year 1486 arrests came from wiretaps in previous years and 55 of arrests led to convictions 76 of the wiretaps were for phones vs pagers email etc 60 were regarding drug offenses and 40 were requested by federal authorities Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487 calls 22 of them incriminating among 131 people and cost an average of 45,125 extrapolating from the 794 installations reporting costs mostly for labor Thus a total of about 40 Million was spent on wiretaps to obtain about 4000 arrests at 10,000 per arrest Thus these arrests are at least four times more expensive than the 2500 per arrest figure one gets by dividing the 28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the total 11 Million non-traffic arrests 3 Thus the 30 Million per year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police expenditures And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone access lines in the country 3 we get about 23 cents spent per year per phone line or about two cents a month In general we deter a given class of criminals through a combination of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted and some expected punishment level if convicted So the social value of having wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other means If unable to wiretap a particular suspect 's phone police might instead use hidden microphones or investigate that suspect in other ways Or police might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps Or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be on average twice as expensive as wiretaps then the annual social benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level of two cents a month per phone line WIRETAP COSTS Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would have offered instead protecting our conversations from the spying ears of neighbors corporations and governments both foreign and domestic Even so the need to support wiretaps would add many additional costs to build and maintain our communication system Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions increasing traffic by some unknown percentage A special process must be used to add encryption keys to chips while securely distributing these keys to special agencies which must be funded and monitored The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor whose design is to remain secret and are manufactured through a special process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of 30 a peice in lots of 10,000 4 Private encryption systems not supporting wiretaps would require none of these extra costs Perhaps most important government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to be represented encrypted and exchanged in our future phones It is widely believed that governments are less efficient than private enterprise in procuring products and standards though they may perhaps perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private standards How much less efficient is a matter of debate some say they pay twice as much while others might say only 10 more Currently a total of 96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of U.S. phone companies 3 which comes out to about 60 per month per access line If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per month we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even as much as one part in 3000 then wiretaps are not cost effective And this does n't even include extra costs phone owners pay because their encryption chips are more expensive Of course most phones would n't have encryption chips for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same so this argument still applies CONCLUSION Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the phone system and the value of wiretaps we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to attach clips to phone wires wiretap support may have been reasonable But when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof is clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs would really be less than the benefits If consensus can not be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate a compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a rate of say five cents per month a tax payable to police agencies nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities 1 The Invisible Weapon Oxford Press ISBN 0-19-506273-6

politics,talk.politics.mideast,At issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed It has happened before and there is reason to believe it still goes on Read this From Ma'ariv February 18 possibly 28 1992 PUBLICATION BAN The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public By Baruch Me'iri All those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way or another Look the subject is too delicate If I comment on it I will be implicitly admitting that it is true If I mention a specific case even hint at it I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public More precisely A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment In Israel of 1993 citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of this country knowing anything about it Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison for security offenses in complete secrecy In the distant past for example during the days of the Lavon YA affair we heard about the third man being in prison But many years have passed since then and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries or in the former Communist countries But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993 The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law the Constitution and Justice MK David Zucker sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment In those cases after being legally convicted the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner asserts MK Zucker On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that There is absolutely no question that it is possible and in some cases it is imperative that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public However one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person 's arrest and on the name of a person sentenced to prison is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment The State of Israel can not be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret wrote Zucker The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that We as the Civil Rights Union do not know of any cases of security prisoners Citizens of Israel who are imprisoned and whose imprisonment can not be made public This is a situation which if it actually exists is definitely unhealthy Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter The Union is aware says Shiffman of cases where notification of a suspect 's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld I am speaking only of several days I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney sometimes for the whole first month of arrest That is done because of the great secrecy The suspect himself his family his lawyer or even a journalist can challenge the publication ban in court But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity The journalist knows nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone is happy Attorney Yossi Arnon an official of the Bar claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible Nothing is easier The court orders a publication ban and that's that Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it Do you find this situation acceptable Attorney Arnon Definitely not We live in a democratic country and such a state of affairs is impermissible I am well aware that publication can be damaging from the standpoint of security but total non-publication silence is unacceptable Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison The trial was held behind closed doors nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to It is somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reasons but as I have noted we at least are aware of his imprisonment Why is the matter actually that serious Ca n't we trust the discretion of the court Attorney Arnon The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them The judges do not have the tools to investigate This gives the government enormous power power which they can misuse And what if there really is a security issue Attorney Arnon I am a man of the legal system not a security expert Democracy stands in opposition to security I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges without entering into detail We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused in the case of the Rachel Heller murder A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public Attorney Shiffman on the other hand believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest or of a convicted criminal 's imprisonment A healthy situation Definitely not But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir Clearly we are speaking of isolated special cases Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication Nevertheless adds Shtendal the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I 've mentioned The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services but with the court which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt Nevertheless attorney Shtendal agrees As a rule clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances

science,sci.crypt,Maybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2 By such a back- door in the encryption algorithm perhaps it would be possible for the manufacturer to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in one session This would not btw enable anybody else to retrieve the keys in the same way because they 'll never get a bunch of 300 N U pairs with identical S1 and S2 Note that these have to be constant for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure i.e. they have to be typed in manually by the random number supplying agents And I was wondering why they 'll always do 300 chips in one session Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the production of every chip at least three persons for one hour each plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular Hollywood-like bonfire add travelling expenses drinks and lighting divide the sum by 300 there wo n't be a larger demand not from the private sector anyway And let me mention one other thought that certainly has occurred to all the notoriously paranoid people in this group before Who is going to verify that _no_ interested party will perform tempest attacks on the vault Where there 's so much smoke and mirrors there ca n't be a nice honest fire but something really worth hiding

recreation,rec.sport.hockey,"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack Injuries Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh Roster Moves Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round 15th overall of the 1992 entry draft 19 years old 6 4 210 lbs In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals 12 assists and 219 PIM He plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well Andre Faust was returned to Hershey He actually left after the second period of the Kings game flew to Albany got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win and played again for Hershey Sunday night Lines Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen Tommy Soderstrom in goal Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period Game Summary If the FLYERS played like this every night they 'd be in the playoffs this year The FLYERS hit everything that moved They created scoring chance after scoring chance They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa 's body should have been a goal but Puppa made a great save reading the play Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25 The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound After the power play the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse who were wrestling in the slot Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10 The FLYERS kept the pressure on and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed Each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners Then Lindros who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score He had Foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards and Mike Mister McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38 The Leafs could n't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive for a change on the kill With time running out in the period Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf 's blue line They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck Macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point He drove it from just inside the blue line Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1 Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone During the power play the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end As time was running out in the advantage Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55 With the assist Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke 's 74-75 season the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117 Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19 Not much happened on the 4 on 4 although the Leafs had most of the possession The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play Tempers flared a little at 13:14 Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors Keith Acton got a bloody face Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3 The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play led by Dimitri Yushkevich Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his He had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net but Soderstrom stoned him The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn't get anything home Shots were 13-10 FLYERS The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period but could n't get past Puppa Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill roughing all at 7:02 Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play At about the 12 minute mark Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom The puck was rolling on it 's side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play On the advantage after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen They kept the pressure on but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01 No punches thrown Recchi got the initial minor Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4 Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill 's face The FLYERS were not happy with that at all 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski and started throwing punches Upward Well Al held his own much to the delight of the crowd Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and Al got a standing O Penalties Eastwood 5 cross check game Clark Carkner 10 each Berehowski and Conroy 5 each fighting at 17:49 So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS The had no interest in stting on the lead Hawgood Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39 That was all the fireworks Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot Puppa did but kept the FLYERS off the board 4-0 FLYERS shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd Probably the strongest game I 've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom all since 1/10 Tied for 2nd most in the NHL but he 's played fewer games than Belfour 6 or the goalie I can't remember that he 's tied with Next up it 's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg The FLYERS can not be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games Last year they had 75 points in 80 games 5 under .500 so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points 5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80 Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left The tragic number for 5th is 5 points I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up Why 5 points instead of 4 Well the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils the Pens twice the FLYERS and finish up with 2 games against the Caps So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on FLYERS team record watch Eric Lindros 38 goals 29 assists 67 points rookie records club record goals club record points

science,sci.med,Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression Note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present I do n't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output but I would tend to doubt it As far as I know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body A regular everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH on the level of circulating Thyroxin there are two types T3 and T4 one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in the liver The ratio of T3 T4 can be affected by a number of other hormones estrogen for example Naturally changing activity of the body 's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual a physician's reference book although reading it is enough to get one depressed and the Encyclopedia Brittanica should be available in your local library I hope this has been of some help

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Nah let 's reserve rec.sports.idiots for people who POST obvious flamebait like yourself If someone posts something as controversial not to mention idiotic as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup someone should challenge the statement There is a school of thought that suggests that silence consent Whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life it certainly SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion which r.s.b is If you 've been reading r.s.b lately you 'll find that even elementary school children have had access to our postings alibet in an edited form It 's making me think a little more carefully about some of the things I post In conclusion if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel in some obscure newsgroup that I do n't read fine He 's got the right to rant rave and drool all he wants to in the name of free speech But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal to his drooling Now of course you do n't have to read any of this And if you want to cut down on flames then DO N'T POST FLAMEBAIT You do n't have to respond to flames either Saves cyberspace

religion,soc.religion.christian,It is important if Christianity is being damaged by it If people who speak in tongues make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the Holy Spirit when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises it damages all Christians since many who are not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects The more modest claim for tongues that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which words fail you is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice I agree with the point that Charismatic practices like this can lead to forms of worship which are more about the worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God one of the things Jesus warned us about

science,sci.crypt,Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read The system may not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units but it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys from escrow This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's coercing or colluding use of some other person 's Clipper phone I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument The original title perhaps should have been Distinction between legal and illegal cipher systems considered harmful but Clipper considered harmful is not inaccurate and is more eye-catching in the current context Assumptions 1 Clipper is made available 2 Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal either on radio systems or on any common carrier system These laws also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio spectrum or other medium characterize signals validate Clipper wrappers detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers and make such detection a cause for further action 3 For escrowed keys to be useful some specific Clipper chip must be associated with a suspected criminal This means that at a minimum some association between the common carrier 's unique phone ID ESN and the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a red flag 4 To reduce ordinary fraud the cellphone system which offers Clipper will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof and much less spoofable than today 's cellphones 5 Criminals want inscrutable communications Some criminals are not entirely stupid or ignorant and will figure out both that Clipper cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a presumably legitimate wiretap order exists They will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone because each one has a unique unit key 6 Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves Because they are not stupid or ignorant or because they read netnews and because they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be detected they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly on some monitorable/tappable channel They know that do so would raise a red flag putting a given cellphone if not a given person under immediate suspicion 7 It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack discover family key F and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip By 2 3 4 and 7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper phone without immediate detection Because it is difficult to obscure one's association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips around the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is associated with someone else A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure communications at least for some limited time T if they buy beg borrow or steal use of someone 's phone in a way that prevents that person from reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T. The encrypted communications might have been recorded and thus be retrievable later but the criminal can delay and quite likely evade discovery by destroying or abandoning the phone before T elapses It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper phone to someone else The honest subscriber does n't want to pay someone else 's bill and he does n't want to fall under suspicion This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use coercion and collusion Coercion first Theft bears a relatively low risk but also sometimes a low time until detection a few minutes if a phone is stolen from a car parked in front of a store a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen from someone who is away on vacation Criminal commerce is likely to arise in stolen Clipper phones with phones coming from risk-inured poor criminals and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals Someone who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected communication like a terrorist could kill a person or hold them hostage The limited time before detection that a coerced phone is useful means that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of freshly coerced phones There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminals and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper phone service for someone else 's use Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal cellphone They will call much less attention to themselves or at least to their stolen phone this way The fact of a phone 's use being coerced must first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone and have its keys obtained from escrow Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super-encryption An automated full-system surveillance mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key F can validate Clipper wrappers and N ESN associations but it can not reveal in realtime the use of super-encryption unless it knows all unit keys which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate pieces upon specific wiretap-like order Whereas a criminal 's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out a criminal 's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper medium would be very difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk recordings as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper chip is fractured If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se then you can charge the criminal with this if you can identify the true criminal he 'll be using someone else 's phone but you 'll have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have been planning You will not even be able to detect that unusual encrypted communications are occurring until you identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more not less secure than they were before Clipper came along I therefore consider Clipper harmful because 1 It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government 2 If other ciphers are proscribed it engenders new types of direct criminal threat to the honest public 3 It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to hide their use of some other cipher making it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress 4 If other ciphers are proscribed lazy investigators and prosecutors are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key escrow is claimed to help against 5 If other ciphers are proscribed the stage is set for witch hunting of illegal cipher use Because any computer can be used as a cipher machine

New York 1952 Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people p. 361 seventh paragraph and p. 362 first paragraph 'The most are inside houses Come you and look 'No dammit My stomach 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform Him you must see We were under those trees by the mosque in an open space I do n't believe you I said but followed to a nail-studded door The man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse I thought I should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and went inside The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for its stone walls had only window slits Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot All looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man 's body lying face up naked but for its grimy turban He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face a rifle butt had bashed an eye The one left slanted as with Tartars rather than with Turks Any uniform once on him was gone so I 'd no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals p. 363 first paragraph 'How many people lived there 'Oh about eight hundred He yawned 'Did you see any Turk officers 'No sir I was in at dawn All were Tartar civilians in mufti The lieutenant dozed off then I but in the small hours a voice woke me Dro 's He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I 'd never heard Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter quick and simple as child 's Both were a cover for his sense of guilt I thought or hoped For somehow despite my boast of irreligion Christian massacring 'infidels was more horrible than the reverse would have been From daybreak on Armenian villagers poured in from miles around The women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul They hauled out every hovel 's chattels the last scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags looms even spinning-wheels 'Thank you for a lot Dro I said to him back in camp 'But now I must leave We shook hands the captain said A bientot mon camarade And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains Like Lot 's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran p. 354 At morning tea Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh Deep in tactics they spoke Russian but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs A campaign shaped more raids on Moslem villages p. 358 It will be three hours to take Dro told me We 'd close in on three sides The men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets Merrimanov said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow That is for morale Dro put in We must keep the Moslems in terror Soldiers or civilians I asked There is no difference said Dro All are armed in uniform or not But the women and children Will fly with the others as best they may p. 360 The ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still Hundreds of feet down the fog held solid as cotton flock 'Djul lies under that said Dro pointing 'Our men also attack from the other sides Then 'Whee-ee his whistle lined up all at the rock edge Bayonets clicked upon carbines Over plunged Archo his black haunches rippling then followed the staff the horde nose to tail bellies taking the spur Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though I heard our Utica brass roar As I watched from the height it took ages for Djul to show clear A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed dogs barked invisible while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle Mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly The came a shrill wailing Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps smoke Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs A mosque stood in clump of trees thick and green Through crooked alleys on fire horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot 'Tartarski shouted the gunner by me Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shell-nose loaded and yanked breech-cord firing again and again Shots wasted I thought when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women 's cries At length all shooting petered out I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul It burned still but little flame showed now The way was steep and tough through dense scrub Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly through alders on smoldering houses Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb p. 361 fourth paragraph Corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair large eyes She looked about twelve years old She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she 'd been toting The bayonet had gone through her back I judged for blood around was scant Between the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun dress The next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and knee-pants He lay face down in the path by several huts One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he 'd carried now upset upon its dough Steel had jabbed just below his neck into the spine There were grownups too I saw as I led the sorrel around Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro 's German-speaking colonel He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead p. 358 more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north My hosts told me of their duty here to keep tabs on brigands Turkish troop shifts hidden arms spies Christian Red or Tartar coming in from Transcaucasus Then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if Versailles were to put as threatened the six 'Armenian' vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan An Armenia without Armenians Turks under Christian rule His lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache That 's bloodshed just Smyrna

religion,soc.religion.christian,I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned and the trumpet had blown I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate They cried for the rock and the mountains They prayed but their prayers were too late The soul that had put off salvation Not tonight I 'll get saved by and by No time now to think of religion Alas he had found time to die And I saw a Great White Throne Now some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation yet Jesus thought it was Paul thought it was Paul said Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men Today too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship We do n't tell people anymore that there 's such a thing as sin or that there 's such a place as hell As Jayne has said this does n't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat Yet the fact remains there is a place called hell A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it Whatever you or I as Christians do we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord if for no other reason to keep them from going to outer darkness. Jesus in Mt 25 tells us that He did n't prepare hell for people He prepared it for the Devil and his angels No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere that God predestined anybody to go to hell D.L Moody use to say that the elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont 's Whether or not that 's theologically sound I could n't defend but its practical Jesus said to the people of Israel Ye would not Now some of you may not be students of the Bible heck -some of you may not be Christians Have you ever said to somebody I do n't believe in hell I believe in the religion of Jesus But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount You 'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire Several times he talks about hell and about judgment In fact over and over in the synoptics Matthew Mark and Luke Jesus talks about hell Not Isaiah Not Moses Not John the Baptist though he did but Jesus the Son of God The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there Now if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain It was our Lord Jesus not some angry Baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and where the fire never goes out Jesus said that It was Jesus who called hell a furnace of fire It was Jesus that used the word condemnation And this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil Jesus said that How can we get it across to you that a loving dying Jesus preached about hell Not only that but He went through hell That 's what Calgary was all about When my Lord was on the cross darkness fell He called hell outer darkness Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there That 's not what hell is Hell 's not a party There 's no fellowship there He called it outer darkness Outer -away from God Darkness -God is light No when He was on the cross He was made sin for you and for me God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated That 's is a sobering thought As my son would say an awesome thought My God My God why hast Thou forsaken me Hell is isolation There 's no fellowship in hell There 's no friendship in hell There 's no loving embrace in hell There 's no hand shake in hell There 's no word of encouragement in hell I thirst It goes much deeper than physical thirst Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction The man whose life was lived for drugs will crave it eternally The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman 's body will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit What is hell Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost In a recent post I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries I 've remembered his name Jack Wertzen and found that the illustration that I gave was n't his His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber 's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack They sing these songs and read Bible verses and their praising this and that -I ca n't stand it Jack do you think God would send me to hell Jack answered by saying Yes I think he would Of course the barber said What do you mean by that Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now what would you do in heaven where they 'll do it for eternity You'd be miserable Because God loves you He 'd put you where it would match what you really are It makes a man think The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act Do n't ask me how I do n't know But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died He died an infinite/eternal death It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the whosoever wills He suffered eternal judgment A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying Everybody is going to be saved eventually -universalism My Bible says no He 'll separate them The sheep from the goats .After you die there 's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven No my Bible says that It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment Some of the cultist believe in annihilation After you die Just like a mosquito you 're squished out No in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven I do n't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you do n't enjoy listening to them but we have to preach the entire Word of God -There is a place called hell If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people are n't going there I 'd give it to you but I have n't found it That fact that there is a place called hell the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we 're responsible the fact that He has placed us in a uni verse that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications 1 As I 've already mentioned If you are a Christian you must worn others Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out Knowing therefore the terror of Lord we persuade men 2 If you have n't accepted Jesus are your Savior you 're taking an awful chance As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses who no longer frequent my door if you are right and I am wrong then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist but if I am right and you are wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation I do n't mean to make fun at this point but its like Dirty Harry said You 've got to ask yourself 'Do I feel lucky Well do you A man 's got to know his limitations Do n't be one of the whosoever wont 's

authentication technologies the possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be realized A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks similar to today 's checking system except entirely digital may be one approach The issues of cryptography privacy and anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an economy See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum

meaning especially on the internet In the general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends such as breaking into systems has been referred to as a hacker but most internet users prefer the term cracker for this Instead a hacker is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system for example -something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot This is the sense intended in this document See also the Hacker 's Dictionary and the FAQ alt-security-faq 5.3 What is a cypherpunk From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for themselves and not expect governments corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers envelopes closed doors and couriers Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or their opinions See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary in soda.berkeley.edu /pub/cypherpunks 5.4 What is steganography and anonymous pools Closely associated with encryption is steganography or the techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication but concealing the very existence of the communication itself Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology For example it is possible to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images typically the most 'noisy In addition when such an item is posted in a public place such as a newsgroup virtually untraceable communication can take place between sender and receiver For steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key An anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman miron extropia.wimsey.com for experiments Send email to pool0-request extropia.wimsey.com with one of the following commands in the subject line subscribe unsubscribe help 5.5 What is security through obscurity Security through obscurity refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them For example a company may not make public information on its software 's encryption techniques to evade attacks based on knowledge of it Another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems Or some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are not widely known or not widely used This argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet posting forgery Security through obscurity is regarded as a very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst also called the head-in-the-sand approach See the FAQ for alt.security Some remarks of John Perry Barlow cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation directed to NSA agents at the First International Symposium on National Security National Competitiveness held in McLean Virginia Dec. 1 1992 Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep contained This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile It's almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate If something hits the Net and it 's something which people on there find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind I believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into an environment where any information which is at all interesting to people is going to get out And there will be very little that you can do about it This is not a bad thing in my view but you may differ 5.6 What are identity daemons RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to query a remote user 's login name after connection to a local communication socket a connection of this type is established during FTP and TELNET sessions for example The standard is not widely supported perhaps 10 of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing The mechanism is detrimental to anonymity Regular users can not disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it This standard may represent a trend toward greater authentication mechanisms 5.7 What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy Remailing/Posting Stable secure protected officially sanctioned and permitted publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET postings Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms chaining encrypted addresses etc Standards for anonymous email addressing embedding files and remailer site chaining General Recognition of anonymity cryptography and related privacy shields as legitimate useful desirable and crucial by the general public and their governments Widespread use and implementation of these technologies by systems designers into hardware software and standards implemented securely seamlessly and transparently General shift of use dependence and reliance to means other than wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement agencies Publicity retraction and dissolution of laws and government agencies opposed to privacy replaced by structures dedicated to strengthening and protecting it ISSUES 6.1 What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF From ftp.eff.org /pub/EFF/mission_statement A new world is arising in the vast web of digital electronic media which connect us Computer-based communication media like electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis of new forms of community These communities without a single fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an electronic frontier While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like newspapers books and telephones the new digital media do not so easily fit into existing frameworks Conflicts come about as the law struggles to define its application in a context where fundamental notions of speech property and place take profoundly new forms People sense both the promise and the threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the workplace and the home The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help civilize the electronic frontier to make it truly useful and beneficial not just to a technical elite but to everyone and to do this in a way which is in keeping with our society 's highest traditions of the free and open flow of information and communication EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor founder of Lotus

the early 1990 's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies on the illicit activities of hackers and phreakers involved in such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery see ftp.eff.org /pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04 Operation Sundevil the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May 8,1990 concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success Bulletin Board Systems went down all over America terrifying the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of their criminal instruments It also saddled analysts with some 24,000 floppy disks and confronted harried Justice Department prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of jurisdictions Massive show-trials never materialized although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued The movement reached a crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of Austin Texas on March 1 1990 From the column GURPS LABOUR LOST by Bruce Sterling bruces well.sf.ca.us in Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional warrant agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the SJG office When they left they took a manuscript being prepared for publication private electronic mail and several computers including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin Board System Yet Jackson and his business were not only innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that somewhere in Jackson 's office there might be a document compromising the security of the 911 telephone system FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier Foundation See information on EFF below From an article by Joe Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1 1993 AUSTIN An electronic civil rights case against the Secret Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago who was in charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1 1990 that led to the lawsuit stoically endured Spark 's rebuke over the Service 's poor investigation and abusive computer seizure policies While the Service has seized dozens of computers since the crackdown began in 1990 this is the first case to challenge the practice Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine that the company was a publisher Indeed agents testified that they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the special Secret Service school on computer crime How long would it have taken you Mr. Foley to find out what Steve Jackson Games did what it was asked Sparks An hour Was there any reason why on March 2 you could not return to Steve Jackson Games a copy in floppy disk form of everything taken Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had a picture of Steve Jackson a law-abiding tax-paying citizen saying he was a computer crime suspect Did it ever occur to you Mr. Foley that seizing this material could harm Steve Jackson economically Foley replied No sir but the judge offered his own answer You actually did you just had no idea anybody would actually go out and hire a lawyer and sue you More than 200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in bringing the case to trial The EFF was founded by Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown ftp.eff.org

Steele in Boardwatch Magazine Feb. 1993 p. 19-22 In a move that worried privacy experts software manufacturers and telephone companies the FBI proposed legislation to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to perform electronic wiretapping The proposed legislation entitled 'Digital Telephony would have required communications service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their systems 'tappable by providing 'back doors through which law enforcement officers could intercept communications Furthermore this capability would have been provided undetectably while the communications was in progress exclusive of any communications between other parties regardless of the mobility of the target of the FBI 's investigation and without degradation of service under the proposal the Department of Justice DOJ can keep communications products off the market if it determines that these products do not meet the DOJ 's own guidelines This could result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for service providers and equipment manufacturers since they will be unlikely to add any features that may result in a DOJ rejection of their entire product the FBI proposal suggests that the cost of this wiretapping 'service to the Bureau would have to be borne by the service provider itself The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of public interest and industry groups from Computer Professionals for Social Responsibilty CPSR and the ACLU to AT T and Sun Microsystems to oppose the legislation A white paper produced by the EFF and ratified by the coalition entitled An Analysis of the FBI Digital Telephony Proposal was widely distributed throughout the Congress The Justice Department lobbied hard in the final days to get Congress to take up the bill before Congress adjourned but the bill never found a Congressional sponsor and was therefore never officially introduced The FBI may reintroduce Digital Telephony when the 103rd Congress convenes in January ftp.eff.org /pub/eff/legislation/fbi-wiretap-bill /pub/EFF/legislation/new-fbi-wiretap-bill A bill to ensure the continuing access of law enforcement to the content of wire and electronic communications when authorized by law and for other purposes Version 2 of the bill after FBI changes in response to public response /pub/cud/law/hr3515 House of Rep bill 3515 Telecommunications Law Commentary /pub/eff/papers/eff-fbi-analysis The EFF-sponsored analysis of the FBI 's Digital Telephony proposal /pub/eff/papers/ecpa.layman The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 A Layman 's View /pub/eff/papers/nightline-wire Transcript of ABC 's Nightline of May 22 1992 on the FBI Privacy and Proposed Wire-Tapping Legislation Featured are Marc Rotenberg of the CPSR and William Sessions Director of the FBI /pub/eff/papers/edwards_letter A letter from the Director of the Secret Service to US Rep.

religion,soc.religion.christian,Larry Thanks for the reply but this is n't quite the same thing Like I said before I can understand why non-Christians would be denied access to holy ceremonies but the ceremony itself communion was not secret In fact all four gospels record the first breaking of the bread in some detail Communion was a fellowship meal and it was and still should be in my opinion inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of the Body of Christ The fact that unbelievers denied access to these communal meals began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact hiding shameful things from the general public In fact I think if you read some of the early church fathers you will find that they were not at all bashful about describing what went on during communion That 's why it seems funny to me when Mormons who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st century Christianity insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they are too sacred Mark

recreation,rec.autos,On the subject of the upcoming new Mustang The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior After the MN12 Thunderbird cost and weight debacle Ford decided independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive wo n't be tried again in a volume car The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years A version of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then Ford is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority Undisguised the car looks OK but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro/Firebird IMO I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird The way GM loses money the temptation to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be great once demand really takes off

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Well -I've- been reading t.p.m for a while and here is what I saw YOU write For balance perhaps you should mention the mosques in Jerusalem that were razed after the Israeli victory in 1967 An eye for an eye I guess Your statment clearly tries to balance Arab atrocities by noting a single incident by the Israelis in war-time at their most holy site You even characterize it as an eye for an eye That would be false If you read your history you will learn that right after the 1967 war the victorious Israelis decided to raze a section of the newly captured East Jerusalem near the Wailing Wall It is in this section that mosques were razed so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque was razed You then followed it with This episode is an example of a good government running amok with newly acquired power Really Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running amok with power with say the Iraqis Your eye for an eye comparisons do n't match the realities that most of us are familiar with This happened to be during a war And a fierce and mighty war it was too Would you say that the Jordanians indiscriminately shot up ancient structures as is their custom in describing bullet holes in the walls of the city This was war It was certainly not any eye for an eye characterstic Israelis do not harbor the same feelings of revenge as the Arabs generally do This is one of the reasons that the Peace Now movement exists in Israel and nowhere else in the M.E

Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17/33B Apartment 15 Microdistrict No 3 Sumgait Azerbaijan On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee about 50 yards away The SK theater They were showing an Argentinian film The Abyss Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee but they were silent there 's no conversation whatsoever and we could n't figure out what was going on That is we knew it was about Karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we did n't know We bought our tickets There were 30 or 40 people in the theater This was a very small number for that large movie theater The film started About 30 minutes later they stopped the film A crowd burst in About 60 people They came up onto the stage Well mostly they were young people from 16 to 23 years old They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to Armenian girls I thought that 's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically Marina and I were sitting together I told her to move over there were some Russian girls sitting nearby So that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not Marina It got quiet 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed it's only opened at the end of the show and they returned to their seats Everyone in the theater was looking at one another Russians Azerbaijanis people of various nationalities But no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound They were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave Some guy a really fat one says OK we 've scared them enough let 's leave They leave slowly pompously It seemed to me that those people were not themselves Either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart Then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all The film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive We could barely sit to the end So it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark Marina and I were walking home Lenin Street that 's the center of town Lenin Street was packed just packed with young people They were shouting something about Karabagh and something about Armenians We were n't especially listening because the way we were feeling we did n't know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway Public transportation was n't running Incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass Everything was broken He stood there grief- stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot Well since he looked more or less calm I decided that nothing all that super serious had happened We went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away We did n't want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen We flagged down a cab but the driver did n't want to take us We told him we live near the bus station and he said he 'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther I said well OK So we got into the cab and managed to get there Something incredible was happening at the bus station There was a traffic jam Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting Ka-ra-bagh they 're not going to give up Karabagh I go home and tell my family what 's going on and there's immediate panic in the house Mamma says what should we do Like the end had come they were going to come kill us that 's it Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up Nothing that bad could happen Where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down And we went to bed But no one could sleep Everyone made as though nothing had happened That was on Saturday In short the day went by We did n't go anywhere and did n't call our relatives No one did anything Because life goes on That day I realized something was approaching but what exactly I couldn't guess On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had There were five of us at home Mamma Papa and us three sisters Lyuda Marina and I My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time We sat at home and no one went out Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning It all started They were smashing up stores We were sitting at home and did n't know anything about it Then a girlfriend of mine Lyuda Zimogliad came by at around three o'clock I think We worked together we did our apprenticeships together she 's a Russian girl She said that something awful was happening in town I asked Do n't they want Armenians Well what are they after if they 're already in that state She says no nothing like that it 's just a demonstration but it 's awful to watch it Somehow it feels like a war has broken out Public transportation has been stopped The cabs the buses well it 's just a nightmare Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time He left the house and our neighbor Aunt Vera asked him Where are you going Stop There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard are n't you afraid to go out Papa did n't know what she was talking about She simply pushed him back into the entryway He came home and told Mamma Mamma said Well if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on But we did n't go see her she 's a Russian she lives across from us I had to see my friend out Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda Ok look it 's time for you to go it 's late already I 'll see you out Mamma says You do n't need to go it 's too late already you can see what the situation in town is So we decided to stay home Dinner was ready Mamma says Let her eat with us then she can go We sat down at the table But no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we 're eating We turned on the television and the show In Fairy-Tale Land was coming on We cleared the table We hear some noise out in the courtyard I go out on the balcony but I ca n't see what 's going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a 9-story building in the way There is mob of people I ca n't figure out what 's happening They 're shouting something looking somewhere I ca n't make out what is going on I go down to a neighbor she 's an Azerbaijani we 've been friends of her family for about 25 years I go down to look from their place I see people shouting looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station Just then soldiers set upon them about 20 people with clubs The mob runs off in different directions I even see several people from our building They are looking and laughing I decide that means it 's not all that bad if they are laughing it means they 're not killing anyone But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers One of the soldiers can not manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone 's kicking him I become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there ca n't speak Well they 've probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is If each of them kicked him just once They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it But it was far away and I could n't see if he got up and left or not I become terrified and go home and say Lyuda do n't go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something We go out onto the balcony All of our neighbors are also out on theirs too Everyone is standing staring The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building As it turns out at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in There 's only one entryway there they could stop them They all run up to our building Mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones They have stones and they break the windows all of them There are very many people We have a large courtyard and it 's packed with people They spill up to the first floor so they do n't crush each other They crawl up on trees posts and garages It 's just a huge cloud of people They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian from our building We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar It 's incomprehensible Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father 's name Grisha open the door we 've come to kill you or something like that I do n't remember that I was spaced out kind of Mamma says Into the bedroom quickly In the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry Mamma says Hide there they probably wo n't come in there they 'll ask something say something and leave She says We 'll tell them that we live alone here I ca n't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts I go to them and say that I 'll stand together with them I 'll talk with them if they come maybe I can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me I speak Azerbaijani more or less and I can find out what they want I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister Lyuda I ca n't remember if I told her anything or not Then they open the door it 's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall The crows bursts in and starts to shout Get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia things like that I tell them What has happened speak calmly One of you tell me calmly what has happened In Azerbaijani they say Get out of the apartment leave I say OK. Go downstairs We 'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals They must be stopped The ones standing in the doorway the young guys say There are old people and one girl with them Too bad They take two or three steps back It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange Then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them Do n't you understand what you are saying Kill them And that was it That was all it took They grab Papa carry him into one room and Mamma and me into another They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs They start tearing my clothes right there in front of Mamma I do n't remember where they went what they did or how much time passed I had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time I do n't even know what I said The atrocities started I was savagely raped in that room They argued among themselves who would go first Later I remember I came to I do n't know if I 'm dead or alive Someone comes in someone tall I think clean-shaven in an Eskimo dogskin coat balding He looks around at what 's happening At that instant everything stops It seems to me that he is either their commander or that somehow everything depends on him He looks and says Well we 're done here They are beating Mamma on the head They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs She loses consciousness and they decide that she 's dead Papa was out cold They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony but they ca n't get the window open Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows ca n't be opened They leave her next to the window She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out She 's not a real strong person anyway He looks at me and sees that I 'm saying something that I 'm still twitching Well I start saying the opposite of what I should be which is humbling myself and pleading I start shouting cursing they do n't get any entreaty out of me I already know that I 'm dead why would I humble myself before anyone And he says that if that 's what I think since my tongue is so long maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing In short he commands that I be taken outside I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda I do n't know if they are alive or not They take me outside They are dragging me by my arms by my legs They are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal While they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me .I do n't even know I think my God when will death come If only it were sooner Then they carry me out throw me near the entryway and start kicking me I lose consciousness What happened after that how many people there were I do n't remember I come to after a while I do n't remember how long A neighbor is bringing me clothing I 'm entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me I remember that I said the same words over and over again Mamma what happened Mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at I ca n't make sense out of anything There is a guy standing over me I sort of know him he served in Afghanistan his name is Igor he brought me indoors When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there Igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though he 's small-minded he put himself at risk Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani he served in Afghanistan There are three brothers The older brother also served there I think now he 's stationed here on the border in Armenia Igor brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying Karina I know you calm down I 'm not one of them How do I know who 's who and what 's what I come to and they clean me up I was covered in blood Then Papa I saw Papa I saw Mamma And Marina too Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed Marina Lyuda said that she was Russian they said we 'll let you go we are n't touching the Russians go And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she 's going to tell them she 's Azerbaijani Igor immediately grabs Marina 's and Lyuda 's hands because he knows Marina and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor 's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there So they survived My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things While they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there Then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor 's on the fourth floor the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door The neighbor opened and said I 'm not going to let you in the apartment because I 'm afraid of them But I 'll give you some stockings and we 'll leave the building Lyuda says I 'll stay at your place because of what 's going on they keep going up and down the stairs It was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor would n't consent Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed I came to Mother was there I ca n't remember my supervisor 's telephone number but something had to be done Somehow I remembered and called and he came to get us He did n't have any idea what was going on He thought we were simply afraid he did n't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death He came and got us and took us to the police precinct There they looked us over I was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe My supervisor 's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov He 's the head of our administration They took us there When we were leaving I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town The buses were ordinary passenger buses There were very many soldiers We left around eleven right after eleven If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives Because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there I think everyone know not only in Sumgait not only in Yerevan Because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping After us I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No 3 and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4 5 and 6 In our building one person died and one old woman died from Building 16 that 's the building in front of ours There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and would n't let it into their building Incidentally when we were at the neighbors Marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was happening I called a aunt in Microdistrict No 5 They have three neighbors who are Armenians I said Run quickly I ca n't explain what 's going on hide do what you can just stay alive Hide at Azerbaijanis ones who wo n't give you away At that moment three people came in policemen I think they were Azerbaijanis I was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and one-half of my face was pushed out forward No one would have thought that I would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all I started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here have n't you killed people people yet what are you doing here One of the soldiers said Do n't scream at us We 're Muslims but we 're not from the Sumgait police They called in from Daghestan So at that point the Daghestan police were there When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen I do n't know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct I do n't know what they were there for There were also doctors from Baku there They examined Lyuda and me and said These women need to go to the Maternity Home but we do n't know what to do with the rest So they took us and I lost contact with my parents my boss everyone My boss said Do n't worry I 'll find you no matter where you are no matter what happens We went to the hospital There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home Pashayeva I think her name was She examined us The ambulance was from Baku I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances had n't done anything they did n't respond to any calls People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite glad I even thought to myself God can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong She looks me over and says Now why are you suffering so You do n't know what your people have been doing your people did even worse things And I think great I have to deal with her And I felt so bad I thought why do n't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did I just did n't have the energy to say How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours have n't already done I stayed there Then they brought in another woman Ira B. she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too There were three of us Ira Lyuda and 1 The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away They did n't do anything to help us This was in the old Maternity Home in the combined block They did n't do anything more than examine me that was it I did n't want any shots or tranquilizer nothing What shots could have calmed me down I did n't even want to look at them I lay in the ward Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose but I was alone I was alone even though the wards were packed That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was disfigured She asked what had happened to me and I said Better to ask your brother what happened there 's no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened She fell into a faint All the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward Then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because I was literally naked The only thing I had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said I ca n't believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here I went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something People from work came and brought me something in a sack apples I think three or four pounds but I could n't take them I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing I said that I could n't take the apples and really did n't have any appetite No one had to bring me anything Some woman took the sack And oh yes Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian maybe they would n't figure it out from looking at me So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen That it would be worse Or perhaps someone was outside on the street I do n't know In any case I did n't sleep a wink that night The next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went I did n't even know where they were taking me They took me to the club where the troops were the very one I was in that ill-fated evening I got off the bus Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible I saw a few people I knew there and that calmed me a little I had already thought that I was the only one left So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night I still did n't know what happened to my parents they did n't come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine I did n't know whether to believe him or not Maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew They all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking What happened what went on Two days later they came to see me from work They were there all the time Each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money They did everything they could Of course I 'm most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who did n't lose his presence of mind and who did n't change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened He constantly took an interest A sincere interest from the heart Then about two days later the secretary of the Party Committee came not from our Party organization but from the First Trust which ours is part of Comrade Kerimov a very important figure in our town He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if I sat down by myself I could n't get up or lie down again There was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to breathe They examined me there several times there I lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows I do n't know They did n't diagnose anything in particular When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful There was no way something inside was n't broken my ribs Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club The mother of one of Marina 's friends was there She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children 's Clinic They had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what I needed at that moment I thought I said that I was having great difficulty breathing I could n't seem to get enough air something was wrong with me They put tight bandages around my chest and waist Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut But I was n't cut They took us to the Khimik boarding house We lived there a long time Soon appeared representatives They were agitating At first people would not talk to them and drove them off One of the Armenian women shouted We demand that Seidov come The response was It 's Seidov who sent us Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers The woman said We 'll only see Seidov 's daughter have her come here we 'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we 'll deal with you agitators And so on More of them said Have Seidov himself come This went on day in day out The agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay Everything got on our nerves The smell the small children There were children at the SK club children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home What were they doing in a club that did n't even have running water all the time At first we had to pay to eat there They even overcharged us as it turned out On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free The children were ill. Everything stank there Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500 You could n't sit or lie down it was impossible to even move The stench was awful Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan the infants They have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care People were fainting right and left I just do n't know everyone was crying everyone Only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together But the women were in a constant state of panic It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there would n't be a single Armenian left Then people went up to the attic I did n't see them I only heard them because I was lying down and could n't get up I lay right on the stage we had some room there Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas I think they wanted to burn the theater Maybe someone saw them I did n't I was in no condition to open my eyes Everyone was suspicious of everyone else They would ask Are n't you an Azerbaijani I think I saw you somewhere I think you 're an Azerbaijani They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each other Half of the people did not have any documents There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their IDs So on the 28th on Sunday I think the police did nothing to help us On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A They did n't spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody They killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew my mother worked with them Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister They were brutally murdered Only the two daughters-in-law survived By a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors would n't take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge She was pregnant and had two small children This all continued on Monday in Block 41A on the 29th when the troops were already in the city They murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families They say they did n't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not I heard that the Lezgins suffered too I 'm not sure myself I did n't see any Lezgins who had been injured They burned cars so it 's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who did n't It was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned it 's all very hard to imagine of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the BTZ plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift Aunt Razmella who also lived in Microdistrict 3 They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait and there were students too They were simply savagely murdered They were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people They stopped the buses dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot I did n't see it myself but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them Later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you ca n't call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student Ira G. if I 'm not mistaken She was in the hospital a long time after that and she still ca n't figure out who saved her She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city I still ca n't imagine how he managed to do that I heard that from Engels Grigorian He knows her apparently Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian and they wrote the words down and I think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape They could n't find the guy who saved her He left her in someone 's apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she could n't remember anyone 's face I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe I had talked with him once But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head I ca n't remember to this day who he was Then it seems I saw the Secretary of the Directorate 's Party organization where Marina works She goes to school and works she goes to night school at AZI and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration I 'm the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations We had joint meetings I know them all I 've even talked with them and he I know is from Armenia An Azerbaijani but from Armenia It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia They took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the Procuracy because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize They showed me the people who were in our apartment they 're working on our case but I ca n't even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones they 're processing it somehow They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that All these people all of them as much as I 've heard about them and seen them they were all from Kafan The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf Najaf Rzayev He was there when everything started It must have been him because I did n't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him All the more since I told him Listen you do something because you know me He turned away and went toward the bedroom where Marina was Well you could n't see Marina anyway There was such a noisy confusion of people that you could n't make out anyone All of it flew right out of my head and then gradually I became myself again at the City Party Committee There were military people there I told them what went on and they wrote it all down I told them his name On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization the one we 're part of came to see us his name is Najaf Rzayev I tell Mamma If he 's here despite the fact that I gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think I 'm crazy not responsible for my words He said What did they do to you how awful myself I hid an Armenian family Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different I was n't at home my family and I went to Baku I said Marina what is he saying He said something totally different before After that I did n't go to see our Procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh Fedorov by name Fedorov told me that Rzayev 's case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved What are they doing with Rzayev Did he prove his alibi or not They just think that since I was hit in the head I ca n't say anything for sure whether it was him or not It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and does n't have to pay for it but at the same time I 'm afraid to say I 'm a hundred percent sure that it was he Because no mat- ter who I name they tell me no you 're wrong he did n't do that that one was n't there All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind Who did what exactly I ca n't say When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but I did n't see it because I had my eyes closed all the time It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out So I had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me A young guy 22 held my arms he works at the BTZ plant And right nearby across the road from us Block 41 is where all this was going on Right across the road from us The BTZ dormitory is over there that 's where he lives Now he 's in custody they even have proved as far as I know that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building One person in our building was killed it was that man A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he did n't come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory A while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned That guy went and told them everything Now they 've caught him everything 's been proved Now evidently they 've been beating him I do n't know what they 're doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant Some young guy came to the plant and said Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten That was it He said the ones who wanted to went This was at the BTZ plant during the night shift probably late Friday night It was at night they were at the sauna together And he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying The others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking I 'm going to go But they didn't say anything to one another He said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that That guy was also born in Kafan That is certain And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia too from I 've participated in the investigation a couple of times I 'm satisfied with them thus far They summoned us and asked about what happened and every word I said was recorded I met some guy there By the way he was an Armenian I said that he was in our apartment but what he did I do n't know His last name was Grigorian Eduard Grigorian He s from Sumgait from Microdistrict 1 He was sentenced I think to five years not his first time His mother is Russian I met with him at the KGB in Baku at the Azerbaijani KGB They took us there and showed me photographs There were so many photographs I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and I 've got them all confused I say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack Well This guy Grigorian I said he was in our apartment but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin I do n't know what he did I ca n't remember Maybe he beat me or raped me But he was in our apartment At the KGB he started asking me pleading with me there 's no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you 're like a sister to me I took a look at him and thought My God Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you But they were satisfied with my responses because I said everything without great certainty I was there with Mamma Then Lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately She wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at him She recognized him When she came to Lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters They stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything Well seeing the faces hearing the voices Two people were saying they could burn the apartment Another says why burn the apartment when I 've got three kids and no place to live So this guy was in temporary housing he did n't have anywhere to live he was from Sumgait They were sure that they would get the apartment Besides the neighbors were Azerbaijani Why should they burn the apartment they might burn Azerbaijanis That 's what they said How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that Armenians lived there We have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us So they did n't set fire to our apartment I do n't know I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside if someone had asked me what was happening I would have said that a civil war was going on Well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror film So a civil war was going on and only the Armenians were being fought If it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting everyone But they only fought us Then I met some women from our building some Azerbaijanis They are crying they tell me Karina we saw all of it how could it happen They 're asking me Well I just do n't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me I think that if it were the other way around either I would n't have been able to take it or I would have tried to avert it like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building A woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads Two Armenian families live there in her part of the building She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse She came down to the entryway and said You 'll come in this entryway over my dead body So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they did n't even know what they were doing I do n't think that 's true They knew very well what they were doing if they did n't even lift a hand against that woman They could n't have cared less about her but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them They were just beasts they had smoked so much When they came to our place they were all chewing something I noticed Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something I think my God maybe I just think that Maybe I 'm losing my mind But no they 're all chewing something Maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young clean-shaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration But they were shouting something They did n't talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there They screamed and screamed Yeah killing killing we 're killing the Armenians Only they did n't shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary Gurun literally means kill or destroy That 's how it was I 'll continue We hid in a captain 's apartment he 's an Azerbaijani his wife is a Tatar We were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard Their kids knew a whole lot This was in our part of the building on the third floor When Mamma came to and could n't find Lyuda she took Papa 's hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they did n't pay attention because they were stealing things Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing Mamma found the courage to A boy said to my mother Where 's the gold Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old He even looked Russian he was so fair-skinned But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned I noticed they were all on the fair side He shouted they were all smashing things and he asks Mamma where the gold is We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers In a little black bag we kept everything in there Mamma does n't really like to wear gold She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass Mamma thinks that the gold saved us Because they threw themselves at the gold and Mamma grabbed Papa who was trying to breathe They had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off He had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them Mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said half-awake What 's happened He sees that they are bloody Mamma said At least go and find out what 's happening to my daughters even if they 've burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses He went looking for us At that moment Lyuda was under the bed She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name When he quietly called her she could n't get out from under the bed She wanted to get out and was calling softly She thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone And again She thought that she had lost her mind I 'll never leave here never To hell with it It just seems that way to me I 'll come to eventually But then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought Lyuda down and Igor carried me in from outside Or first I was brought in then Lyuda I do n't remember what order it happened in And Mamma said Listen they 're all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building It had more or less calmed down where we were Who 's dead who 's alive we do n't know I tried to call my girlfriend I had basically come to Mamma says Listen let 's go upstairs at least get a mattress or something We do n't know how long we 'll be here Maybe they did n't burn everything I do n't get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken I tell Mamma Mamma what do you need any of that for To hell with it We 're alive forget the rest of it all of it She says No let 's go get at least something Maybe we 'll leave here spend the night at someone else 's Mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son Alik was standing on the lookout lIe was standing there to see if they were coming They only managed to run up there and grab something one time He shouts Come back they 're coming They did n't have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another Mamma got my knitting Someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall Someone took Father 's old coveralls The neighbor his wife Mamma and Papa Marina went with them I was in no condition to leave Neither was Lyuda We just sat They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they 're dragging something again They were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or There was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there Then things more or less calmed down I tried to call my boss Later there was more noise We were on the third floor in a one-bedroom apartment and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor Asya Dallakian She 's an old woman retired She was n't at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the army She is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant They started pounding on her door and broke it down She had two or three beds in there something like that she 's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there Probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television When her grandson came she bought a television They started wrecking everything I started getting sick again I think My God what is going on around here When will this end We turned off the lights and sat As it turns out the people who were n't afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights We did n't know but they did n't come to where we were all the same They all knew very well that he was a captain He went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment His last name was Kasumov He 's an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other He went out and stood at his door They tell him Comrade Captain do n't worry we wo n't harm you you 're one of us He went upstairs and they say Are n't you taking anything from this apartment He says I do n't need anything And the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard saw Those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again The women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property Some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a rug A guy came downstairs really mad and he says Where 's the rug I just put it right here They tell him Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school He ran off in that direction Oh I forgot the most important point When Igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on They just did n't tell me about it for a long time The wife of that military man she did n't want to kill my spirit I was already dead enough Later she told me that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said Where 's the girl who was here And he became furious The woman tells him She came to She didn't know what to say Think something up Someone carried her off Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family So the woman says She came to and went to the basement Now our basement is full of water So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse They took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil They climbed down in there to get me Then one of them said There 's so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died She met her death in the basement That 's it we can leave no problem I did n't know that and when I was told I felt worse Two times worse A lot worse So they did n't just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me After that we of course did n't want to live in Sumgait any longer We really did n't want to go back to our apartment When we moved I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because I started remembering it all Although the neighbors all sobbed it was all so cheap The people who sat in their apartments and did n't help us at a time like that I think that they could have helped I do n't think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself That means they could have too It would have been enough foe one man or women to say What do you think you 're doing That 's all That would have done it There were 60 apartments in our building Not one person said it When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I did n't hear anyone 's voice no one said what are you doing leave her alone Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian They would have stood up for one of their own True they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom The Azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop immediately The old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said If you want to go on living you 'll disappear into your apartment So she left That trick did n't work on them Even the neighbors who helped us move told me OK fine calm down forget that it happened I said I 'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter and if that did n't have any effect on them then I would forget everything too Imagine that it happened to your sister And no one did anything Anything April 25 1988 Yerevan reference 1

recreation,rec.sport.hockey,Here 's a summary of Don Cherry 's Coach 's Corner from April 21 1993 The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night Warning Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post Topics Don 's Tie Grant Fuhr Penalties Wings vs Leafs Fighting Dale Hunter Episode Summary This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don 's tie Don was pointing out the characters on the tie Bugs Bunny Foghorn Leghorn and Yosemite Sam who Don called Lanny Macdonald Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night 's games because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr Don began to praise Fuhr calling him the greatest goalie and said that he 's winning the series against Boston all by himself He then showed clips from earlier episodes Nov. 14 Jan. 16 when Fuhr was still with the Leafs and Don advised Do n't Trade Fuhr Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston it would be Fuhr who wins the series Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade but Don feels Muckler 's been vindicated The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game where Domi hit a Vancouver player and was given a 2 min penalty Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder Don Its sad what they 're doing for hockey a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed Next they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke Wendy for not fighting However Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking It 's like college hockey The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody That 's why you 're seeing so much stickwork Because they know you wo n't drop your gloves and give them a shot The rules are made by people who do n't know what 's going on in hockey The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game When he was younger Hunter was taught to play to win which differs from today 's idea of just letting kids have fun At then end of the episode they showed a clip from a coach's corner with the tape on fast forward so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks Rating Typical anti-fighting posturing not too much humour but some good quotes I 'd give it a 7.0 out of 10 |Allan Sullivan allan cs.ualberta.ca |Department of Computing Science |University of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada |My opinions are mine and mine alone It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit U. of A Golden Bears Hockey Motto C.

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,This is the crux of the argument to me at least Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense is basically nonmeasurable at present You can talk about how important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls in the dirt But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher 's rank in defense Looking at Lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher As far as I can tell he does n't have any particular problem in his mechanics such as Sasser He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time I ca n't see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors All we 're left with is the calling the game aspect Olsen and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavine 's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine Similarly I wouldn't be supprised if the pitcher 's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen But given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez Now since Lopez ca n't learn how to handle the major league pitcher 's while he 's in AAA and since he does n't have any glaring problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in AAA that he ca n't learn just as well while in the majors

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66 True Cone is probably as good as Drysdale and they have no Koufax but still these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with lots of low-scoring games etc And they did n't use relievers whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them That being said I still picked them 5th or so but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting There 's more of a chance of that I think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching At least to me I wonder though which one do you people think would do better a team with Johnson Koufax in his prime Seaver Carlton and Young in no real order as the starters with Sutter Fingers and Lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assuming good defense like Mazeroski Maranville etc Or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of Cobb Carew Ruth Gehrig Mays Schmidt Wagner and Bench again you pick the order I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons end Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts taking all the players in their prime they might throw 50 shutouts in a year And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all- time teams into a regular season have it played and report the results I would love to see that

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,Hi I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM It is an S3 86c805 based card I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video and thanks to Orchid I got a fix from their tech support it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual I assume it would come with memory ordered from them so I guess I should be glad they did n't just say Buy the memory from us or something like that The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that given 2MB of memory All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256 Just ONE more mode GEEZ Had I known I would n't have bothered I asked them why and all I got was Your point is well taken but Orchid 's software developers are busy with other projects So to get to the point finally ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes I 'd love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it 's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken If you want these modes steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards ie VLB or VA/VLB at least until their developers are less busy If the magazines are to believed I 've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color Genoa although evenn that might be a misprint Please if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there let me know where I can get them 800x600x32k is OK but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL

religion,soc.religion.christian,Hello Firstly what do you exactly mean by fundamentalist I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God 's word to mankind I suspect that what happened to him is what he 'll call being born again Anyway was that recent If the answer is yes to all the questions above it is quite understandable However IMO I'ld rather give advice to your friend I think I 've been through something similar to him and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews Why he talks about those things is because they are now obvious to him What is obvious to him is not obvious to you Secondly why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view he has been on both sides of the fence This I mean that before he turned fundamentalist you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side If suddenly as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him it is like the discovery of let 's say a new continent or a new planet To him he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was and what he thinks is much better than where you are now You have got to realise that from his point of view he means well to you eventhough he may end up offending you To him it is worth that risk Nevertheless it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well At this moment it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about however he may not realise that he 's really putting you off So far I 've only been trying to explain things from his side However I do understand how you feel too because I was n't a Christian for a good part of my life as well I was quite turned off by Christians or fundamentalists who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith They really scared me to tell you the truth Unfortunately religious belief is a very personal thing just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian religious or otherwise it will be a touchy matter Like all friendships it will take both sides to do their part to make it work In this matter maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about that it 's beyond you or not your concern for now Do n't tell him it 's nonsense because to him it is reality and that would be a real insult He 'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too Like I said before I wish I could give your friend some advice too I 'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian In some ways I wish I could have done things a little differently However it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I 've found To me it was too good not to know To some I was crazy and I did n't really care most of the time what they thought You will probably think he 's crazy too but God is very real to him as real as you are to him Keep that in mind And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him he does n't see why God ca n't be real to you too I do n't know how helpful this is to you But all the best anyhow this is quite a challenge for you to face By the way personal conviction nobody is beyond saving except the one we call the devil and his hosts

religion,talk.religion.misc,Actually jon that is quite true Christian people have caused objective morality to look very relative After all that was the point of the original question in this thread i.e can we toss out Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own principles If you will bear with me I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian 's viewpoint If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims then He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick physically emotionally etc GOD has an objective morality for us That is to say He has no trouble understanding what is good for or detrimental to the creature He created Galatians 2:10 For we mankind are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works a morality which God prepared beforehand a well-defined design that we might walk in them However contrary to what many people assume including the Pharasees of the Bible God 's morality can not be completely codified in a list of rules and regulations To some extent every activity of a person 's life creates a new situation to which morality must be applied There never could be enough volumes to codify God's objective morality for us Throughout history mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of rules objectivity if you please In the Old Testament we have both principles and specific rules By the time of Jesus most of the principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the application of the principles We mankind were n't comfortable with the subjectivity of principles For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference between the Law and the principles of the Law For example in verses 21-22 You have heard that the ancients were told 'You shall not commit murder and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the court The objective morality of God gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it We Christians have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intended for us If we Christians would stay committed to seeking God 's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's objective morality for themselves If Jesus is who he said he was/is and that 's the fundamental question then HE IS objective morality

politics,talk.politics.misc,Your comment here is meant as a put down It fails for several reasons 1 You have edited out the context of the action under discussion 2 I never brought the legal definition up I use the English language and not the legal dialect The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any case The context of the discussion is morality of censorship You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric Argument by example I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply thus the action is not permisable Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed it would be contrary to the internet comercial use Now you are clutching at straws In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was important The typeface etc is inconsequential If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into soc.culture.british If you are suggesting that advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it directly Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Rushdie Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech That is irrelevant the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy For example if a Microsoft employee were to post Windows NT is crap do n't buy it from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee In the same way if a company decides that it has political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views ah yes you did not quote them merely refered to them Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment your signature and pretty well damn all else Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions Plus I am not an absolutist I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line Furthermore I do n't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply I do n't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat
science,sci.space,Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies The large grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency However at temperatures below 100 K 90 of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns where radiating efficiency is poor A small antenna can not easily radiate at long wavelengths Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed Moreover the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them In the extreme limit grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation Worse still IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of small grains These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K. Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K. Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed average temperature A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust color temperature 5500 K thermal emission from Zodiacal dust Tc 280 K and thermal emission from Galactic dust Tc=25 K At the ecliptic poles the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13 4E-8 and 2E-5 The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane To find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components then take the fourth root In the table below starlight comes from Allen 's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75 No doubt careful work could do much better The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong We would be cooked if that were the case In any event the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background and I believe that to be correct Dilution Temp DT^4 Microwave background 1 2.7 53 Galactic dust 2E-5 25 8 Zodiacal dust emission 6E-8 280 369 Zodiacal dust scattering 3E-13 5500 275 Starlight 1E-13 5500 92 797 The fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K. Outside the Solar system the result would be 3.5 K. I find these results surprising especially the importance of Zodiacal dust but I do n't see any serious mistakes

religion,soc.religion.christian,"This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine THE DOCTRINE OF GOD I THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD Of all of the doctrines of Scripture this is the most important The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God Therefore our first objective in studying the Bible should be to know God I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three Persons in the Godhead Trinity God the Father God the Son the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Holy Spirit I believe that they are individual Persons who are one in nature meaning that They are identical in nature each possessing the same divine attributes They are also equally worthy of our worship our trust and our obedience Cf Matt.28:19 2 Cor.13:14 John 14:8,9,16,17 II THE ATTRIBUTES or CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GODHEAD A God 's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for Himself Jehovah He is the living God eternal and unchanging He is without beginning and without ending Cf Isa.42:8 B God is a spirit Cf John 4:24 C. God is love Cf 1 John 4:8,16 As such He is gracious merciful good faithful patient and full of lovingkindness Cf Psa 89:1,2 Psa 103:8 Nahum 1:7 D. But God is also holy and righteous He is absolutely without sin in His nature and so is incapable of sinning in though word or action Cf Ex 15:11 Isa 6:3 E. God is omnipresent everywhere present at the same time in the completeness of His Person omniscient all knowing knowing all things the end from the beginning infinitely wise omnipotent almighty sovereign with unlimited power over all creation God is infinite in His presence wisdom and power It is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day has become very man-centered and that the people in our churches know very little about God I believe that the Lord 's work needs to be God-centered and that the people of God need to understand that God is sovereign in all things in the affairs of nations in the lives of all people and in the carrying out of His purposes regarding salvation III THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD A In creation All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in creating and all Three are active in sustaining creation and in ordering the course of human affairs for nations as well as individual people to the end of time Cf Gen. 1:1,2 John 1:1-3 Col. 1:16-17 Heb 1:3 B In salvation In order to understand salvation I believe that it is absolutely necessary to begin with God not with man All three Persons of the Godhead have been and are active in salvation 1 God the Father Salvation originated with God The Members of the Godhead determined in eternity past that there would be salvation the conditions under which people could and would be saved and even who would be saved Election to salvation is recognized in Scripture as the work of God the Father Cf Eph 1:3-4 2 Thess 2:13-14 2 Christ the Son of God The Lord Jesus Christ through His birth by the virgin Mary came to the earth to accomplish two important works a He came as the final and complete revelation of God the Father Cf Col 1:15 heb 1:1-3. b He came to provide salvation for all whom the Father had chosen He did this by His death on the Cross by His bodily resurrection and by His present intercessory work in heaven The work of salvation will be completed for us when the Lord returns Cf Rom 5:8-10 1 Cor 15:3- 4 Heb 7:25 1 John 3:2 3 The Holy Spirit As the Author of Scripture the theme of which is Christ and His redemptive work the Holy Spirit is carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the following ways a He convicts of sin Cf John 16:7-11 b He regenerates known in the Bible as the new birth Cf John 3:5-8. c. He indwells each believer to fulfill the work of sanctification Cf John 14-16-17. d. He seals every believer in Christ thus making salvation secure Cf Eph 1:13-14. e. He baptizes every believer into the body of Christ Cf Cor 12:13 f. He teaches every believer the truth of Scripture Cf John 14:26. g.

religion,soc.religion.christian,Woo So far we 've had the following interpretations of the figure of the Whore of Babylon in Rev 17 18 a The United States of America b MHO dB which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who corrupt and oppress human society c Historical Jerusalem d Historical Rome Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning How about The prophecy reveals God 's judgement on the corrupt idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people d That God 's judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city c because despite that City's special call it still rejected God 's grace at the decisive time Rev 11:8 also is n't Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon a and is equally subject to God 's judgement That the Good Book TM actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've created b Clever huh Flame here No need to argue at all I think Mary 's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a deliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 the mortal Jerusalem chosen by God but never historically fulfilling its vocation and the new Jerusalem perfected outside of history purely by God's grace eg Details like Rev 17:1 who sits on many waters cf Rev 22 the single stream in the new Jersualem the river of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb

computer,comp.windows.x,Some people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and it seems that someone out there just might have done it already and can point me to some tools that would help What they 'd like to do is Given a window that is taking a long time to draw because either the data is arriving over a slow link or the DISPLAY is across a slow link they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of the picture and then repaint it in higher resolution Thus the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution with each 4x4 square of pixels being filled in with a single color Next each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares finally the 1x1 version would be painted Since one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link the low-res version obviously would n't be transmitted as a bitmap that would n't help at all Instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the low-res picture as a small bitmap and blows up each pixel into a square sorta like the magnifier programs do This brings up the question of whether the X server can help That is when a window is opened is there a way to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels Or is the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process Permission denied and have it open a local window It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts up such a program remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to expand But if there is something that X itself can do to help it 's be nice to hear about it I looked in several FMs but if it 's there I obviously do n't know the keywords If someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all we might want to get a copy Oh yes this is to run on some Suns Part of the idea is to build demos that can show such things as If this were run across say a 4800-bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear Then the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for

Martin juando cnm.us.es Starting your Server Joe English joe trystero.art.com If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one After I changed my .xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time we have a heavily loaded system without much core though This sounds crazy but I have confirmed that it works Warner Losh imp Solbourne.COM provided me with a good explanation of why this works which I have summarized here When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts This process touches a large number of pages Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU and more importantly memory If you put a sleep in there you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up Similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth All this activity is typically memory intensive Once this initialization is done The process has reached a steady state the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation 's limited resources This is most definitely a Your Mileage May Vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered available RAM local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm I 've experimented with sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 2 exec xbiff sleep 3 exec xterm sleep 4 exec xterm I 've even tried sleep 2 exec start_X_clients_script and then in start_X_clients_script I had sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched All of these yielded fairly comparable results and so I just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you Fonts Loading fonts takes time and RAM If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you 'll get speed increases in load-up time One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients or at least all your heavily used clients to use only those few fonts Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server This will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server Farrell McKay fbm ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au Joe English joe trystero.art.com eg My main xterm font is 7x13 so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it 's menus and icons etc Twm 's default font is 8x13 Since I do n't normally use 8x13 I 've eliminated one font from my server Oliver Jones oj roadrunner.pictel.com Keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts use a font server About the Resources File Keep your .Xresources .Xdefaults file small Saves RAM and saves on server startup time Joe English joe trystero.art.com One suggestion In your .Xdefaults .Xresources file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications For example reverseVideo true Then separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files For example HOME/lib/app-defaults In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH HOME/lib/app-defaults/ N The comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work ed So when xterm launches it loads its resources from /app-defaults/XTerm Xdvi finds them in /app-defaults/XDvi and so on and so forth Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern You can check in your system app-defaults directory often to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name This is all documented in the Xt Specification pg 125 666 Thanks to Kevin Samborn samborn mtkgc.com Michael Urban urban cobra.jpl.nasa.gov and Mike Long mikel ee.cornell.edu Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits Easier to maintain more usable Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resources Applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them It also has drawbacks the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up This does n't seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability If you are modifying an application 's resource database you just need to re-run the application without having to xrdb again xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not WATCH OUT FOR THIS I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file which cpp stripped out When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources Xt did NOT provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file The loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e.g ifdef COLOR is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management You may also run into some clients which break the rules For example neither Emacs 18.58.3 nor Xvt 1.0 will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources Casey Leedom casey gauss.llnl.gov A possible compromise suggestion that I have and am planning on trying is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my .Xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that I seldom use Define Your Display Properly Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server In that situation rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to hostname :0.0 where hostname is the name of your workstation you should set your DISPLAY variable to unix:0.0 or :0.0 By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to Patrick J Horgan pjh70 ras.amdahl.com See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X 1 man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name I do n't think it 's stock MIT but at least Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY is n't set specially Rob Sartin 88opensi sartin uunet.UU.NET Jody Goldberg jody algorithmics.com sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set I do n't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here Hopefully MIT will apply this minor ~8 lines patch themselves In the meantime if you want to try it yourself email Jody ed Clients If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running For example Is there a smaller clock program than xclock Unfortunately I have n't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients eg Xclock Xterm Xbiff are welcome ed I 've received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of X client programs Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based since Xt Xaw and other toolkits are rather large Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries In this case using a non-Xt for example client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed The upshot of all this seems to be Do n't mix toolkits That is try and use just Athena clients or just Xview clients or just Motif clients etc If you use more than one then you 're dragging in more than one toolkit library Know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment Thanks to Rob Sartin 88opensi sartin uunet.UU.NET Duncan Sinclair sinclair dcs.gla.ac.uk sinclair uk.ac.gla.dcs A

Better Terminal Emulator for X From the README file distributed with xterm Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution Ugly maybe but at my site it 's still the most used I suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites Laziness Is n't there a better terminal emulator available See below If you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage Oliver Jones oj roadrunner.pictel.com Jonny Farringdon j.farringdon psychol.ucl.ac.uk 1 Xvt suggested by Richard Hesketh rlh2 ukc.ac.uk available export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z if you do n't need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog This was written as a partial 'clone of xterm You do n't have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be XTerm In it 's current version you can not bind keys as you can in xterm I 've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but I 've not found any yet UPDATE March 1993 I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin brian.warkentine eng.sun.com regarding xvt He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm For instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed try this quickie benchmark /bin/time dd bs=40 and see which program can scroll faster Also while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements We do n't have any hard numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm 's paging requirements are not that major As an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm In summary Caveat Emptor your mileage may vary If you can provide some hard data I 'd like to see it Specifically How much RAM each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each 2 mterm suggested by der Mouse mouse Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU available larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 132.206.1.1 in /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax I also have my own terminal emulator Its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway Tuning your client Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster From Scott Barman scott asd.com comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget or even just a text widget the I-beam cursor will blink Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server CopyArea The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0 It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC but it does make a little difference on a slower system This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas Consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests Miscellaneous Suggestions Pretty Pictures Do n't use large bitmaps GIF 's etc as root window backgrounds The more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc These take up RAM and CPU power I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues I ca n't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window I 'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation If you 're anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao azhao cs.arizona.edu for reminding me of this one ed A Quicker Mouse Using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse I use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist See the xset man page for further ideas and information

trystero.art.com To speed up applications that you 're developing there are tons of things you can do Some that stick out For Motif programs do n't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons labels lists et al use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget Again stick to as few fonts as possible Better yet do n't use Motif at all It 's an absolute pig Do n't create and destroy widgets on the fly Try to reuse them This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too Use a line width of 0 in GCs On some servers this makes a HUGE difference Compress and collapse multiple Expose events This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one Francois Staes frans kiwi.uia.ac.be Just a small remark I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc but I did n't find the time yet I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable somewhat 5 times faster Any confirmation on this from anyone ed Andre Beck Andre_Beck IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de Unnecessary NoExpose Events Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it 's event-loop again and again Thousands of XChangeGC requests This Gfx Context Switching is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again Xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection by moving it toward the client startup phase Say What Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first David B. Lewis by day dbl osf.org by night david craft uunet.uu.net How about this swap displays with someone else Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your machine onto the other display Goal reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server I 'm not in a situation where I can easily try this but I have received the following confirmation Michael Salmon Michael.Salmon eos.ericsson.se I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big difference I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion This helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB it was essential when I only had 8 MB Casey Leedom casey gauss.llnl.gov The X11 Server and the client are competing for the same CPU as your server when you run it on the same machine Not really a major problem except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing Timothy H Panton thp westhawk.uucp Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU 's are mostly idle X's cpu usage is bursty so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action The second factor is that context switches are expensive using 2 cpu 's halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe allowing even fewer context switches Other Sources of Information Volume 8 in O'Reilly 's X Window System Series X Window System Administrator 's Guide is a book all X administrator 's should read Adrian Nye adrian ora.com A lot more tips on performance are in the paper Improving X Application Performance by Chris D.

politics,talk.politics.mideast,In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion Those who do n't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner legally responsible for their deeds I can not accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats PS My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice I do n't consider that justice is done when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland This can at best be called pragmatism a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong It can never be called justice And peace without justice will never be peace It is my conviction that the situation in which a state through the law attempts to discourage mixed marriages as Israel does is not normal Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies such as the United States in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency such a Fund would not be needed any more I do n't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions why not But this is not the affairs of a state Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized Such behaviour is not good for Judaism

recreation,rec.motorcycles,For those of you who are thinking about fiamms you might also want to think about airhorns I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from Dennis Kirk pg 282 of the latest catalog on my '85 FJ1100 They are rated at 93db at 7 meters I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing You have to remove the front fairing to do this but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing The compressor is about 2 in diameter and about 5 long The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops but behind the turn signals The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into The short horn is even with the fairing and the long one sticks out about an inch or so but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you If you have any other questions about the mounting email and I can try to explain better If your bike is not red then you may want to paint them first How do they work you ask They are very very very LOUD They sound more like a european sports car than a truck but a vast improvement over stock I have used them at least daily since installing them and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet although the duration of the horn blasts have been short I 've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them even though they know that I have the horns they still jump They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk The bottom line is they work are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages as well as take a few years off their lives and are relatively easy to install on the FJ YMMV

science,sci.med,To start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible So there 's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this On the other hand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying You people call THIS science My opinion for what it 's worth is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation I do n't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science My second point though is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific Within mathematics I think there are several examples especially before the twentieth century One conspicuous case is that of Riemann who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove Later mathematicians did prove them of course I think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what 's not as it is a matter of convincing other people People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one 's results is an essential element Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation Admittedly my question was not at all well posed A considerable amount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer The science I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century I certainly was n't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of reason and observation One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects
recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Yes But this is irrelevant You 're talking about averages when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on I might as well say We know that very very few people are more than 7 feet tall so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4 Why is n't Lopez likely to hit that well He hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than Olson or Berryhill did By a lot As for rushing If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and I don't believe there is then would n't you rather waste Lopez 's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season The sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample but rather that he had n't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up Most players are never ready for the bigs What does this have to do with Javy Lopez See above But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds Most players are n't that good so they probably wo n't be that good this year either And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble Not superstars not stars not even good players Maybe average if we're being charitable Ummm Justice is a very fine hitter Pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell Gant is a big question mark The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten OBP or SLG depending on who 's in Blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop Wan na bet The difference between Lopez 's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play I 'll take the latter every time Just like Keith Mitchell did That was me and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really do n't understand how good Lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization Well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted

computer,comp.graphics,Look for edge inconsistencies Consider two vertices p and q which are connected by at least one edge If p q is an edge then q p should not appear If both p q and q p appear as edges then the surface flips when you travel across that edge This is bad Assuming warning warning warning that you have an otherwise acceptable surface you can pick an edge any edge and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge 0 pick an edge p q and mark it as OK 1 for each face F containing this edge if more than 2 oops make sure that all edges in F are consistent i.e. the Face should be p q q r r s s t t p Flip those which are wrong Mark all of the edges in F as OK and add them to a queue check for duplicates and especially inconsistencies do n't let the queue have both p q and q p 2 remove an edge from the queue and go to 1 If a marked edge is discovered to be inconsistent then you lose If step 1 finds more than one face sharing a particular edge then you lose Otherwise when done all of the edges will be consistent Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT Deciding which way is OUT is left as an exercise

computer,comp.sys.mac.hardware,Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds Your mileage may vary The top speed you achieve can not be predicted before hand My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far I did n't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds Parts Clock Oscillators 4 pin TTL variety You will need a selection of speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up The CPU will run at 1/2 the oscillator speed The original one is a 50 mhz unit I recommend getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for less than 5.00 each Some of their part numbers are 50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part X121 62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part X136 66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator part CTX137 Do n't get the half size clock oscillators They wo n't fit There are also CMOS clock oscillators I have n't tried one in a Quadra They work fine in IIsi 's Socket Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as a 14 pin DIP package Alternatively use 4 machined socket pins from an Augat style socket Just cut them out of the socket Cooling Fan A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a must My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had a fan built onto it It had a pass-through connector which tapped into the hard drive power cable You should rig up something similar or risk frying your CPU Procedure 1 Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here 2 Remove the top lid of the machine You will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower Follow the usual anti-static precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do this Unplug ALL cables wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac 3 Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply You may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply Leave that alone The plastic tab from the tower is all you need release 4 Look at the rear of the tower assembly You will see the flat ribbon SCSI connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive Disconnect all these from the motherboard The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it 5 Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount 6 Look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower A phillips head screw is at the base Remove it taking care not to drop it into the case A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here 7 Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower This tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case 8 Remove the interrupt switch assembly It is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left front edge of the motherboard Pull the middle rear plastic prong up and forward The entire device will release 9 Unplug the speaker cable Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case 10 Remove the motherboard form the case Lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm This allows it to clear the clear plastic Power light guide Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm The motherboard then comes directly out 11 Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal It is a small metal box near the CPU chip Note and remember its orientation The new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator Some of the pins may be bent over Simply desolder then unbend them Be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task This is NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience The motherboard is a multi-layer design with very fine traces easily damaged without proper care 12 Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was 13 Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket You could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins This may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later I suggest using a new 50 mhz clock 14 Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification 14 Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place 15 Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard 16 Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 1 cm posterior of its intended position Lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case Once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place 17 Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY DRIVE CABLE 18 Replace the phillips head screw 19 Drop the power supply straight

the usual power on chord If it does n't something is amiss Immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork If all is not well you have my sincere condolences Hopefully all will work normally Turn the machine back off and replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one Reboot and be astounded You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable With my VSO a machine lock-up might take 8 hours of operation to occur In the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator 36 hours I have not had a single problem Good Luck to all who attempt this modification There is a small but real risk but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than 50 in parts

religion,alt.atheism,Size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of size In this case I 'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons Western news in general but in particular the American mass media CBS NBC ABC etc The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor Iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits I agree Perhaps so And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too But that 's easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 90 's right Back then it was all-out war and Germany and Japan had to be squashed After all a million or more British had already died hundreds of thousands of French a couple hundread thousand or so Americans and millions of Russians not to mention a few million Jews Poles and other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps All things considered the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses I for one do n't regret it Sure And it 's the people who suffer because of them All the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war It is evident that the West especially America misjudged Hussein drastically But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply he had to be stopped Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait but it is still Hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade And once he did so a strong response from the West was required Well it 's not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion So I 'd have to say yes stopping Hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest I mentioned it If we had n't intervened allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would have been appeasement It is precisely the lessons the world learned in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia Sure What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a Thousand Year Reich The consequences stemmed from that What should I say about them Anything in particular So It was the policemen on trial not Rodney King And under American law they deserved a jury of their peers If there had been black officers involved I 'm sure their would have been black jurors too This point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow So It 's hard to imagine So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of Constructing a Logical Argument Can we expect another revision soon Just kidding I have to admit that I wonder this too But neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking So one can not conclude either way due to the silence of the principals OK It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved And frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm A charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under California law Based on what the prosecution was asking for it 's evident that the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty Note not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm The seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then I feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one Thanks mathew I like the quote Pretty funny actually I 'm a Monty Python fan you know Kind of seems in that vein Of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory But then you know that already Regards

Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display by Paul Heckbert SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings page 297 There are other algorithms but this one works well and is fairly simple Implementations are included in most raster toolkits see item 7 below A variant method is described in Graphics Gems p. 287-293 Note that the code from the Graphics Gems series is all available from an FTP site as described above Check out John Bradley 's Diversity Algorithm which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual The ImageMagick package see section 7 for where it is contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the other algorithms but slower There 's also an implementation of Wan Wong and Prusinkiewicz _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_ Transactions on Mathematical Software Vol 14 2 June 1988 pp 153-162. avialable as princeton.edu pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar This code in modified form appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well 4 Converting color into grayscale The NTSC formula is luminosity .299 red .587 green .114 blue 5 Quantizing grayscale to black white The only reference you need for this stuff is Digital Halftoning Robert Ulichney MIT Press 1987 ISBN 0-262-21009-6 But before you go off and start coding check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b w conversion 6 Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination Instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source This method is quite general and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping not just rotation You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling However there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit see below an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS Reference A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation by Alan Paeth awpaeth watcgl.waterloo.edu Graphics Interface '86 Vancouver An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal An updated version of the rotation paper appears in Graphics Gems see section 1 under the original title 7 Free image manipulation software There are a number of toolkits for converting from

information there 8 Format documents for TIFF IFF BIFF NFF OFF FITS etc You almost certainly do n't need these Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software Get one or more of these

three-dimensional object formats The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as Mark Hall foo cs.rice.edu will apparently no longer be maintaining it A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol koziol ncsa.uiuc.edu The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats Apparently neither of these is complete you might want to check both FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System It 's a file format most often used in astronomy Despite the name it can contain not only images but other things as well There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits read it if you want to know more 9 Converting between vector formats A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript or MacDraw to CGM or whatever It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7 Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats This is not so for vector formats The basic objects circles ellipses drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles etc vary from one format to another Except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu The contributor states that it runs on Unix MS-Windows and possibly the Mac A better more specific blurb would be most welcome On the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another As far as I know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc Check the index on your nearest archive site A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from PostScript to Sun raster format or HPGL to X11 bitmap For example some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC 's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer Also the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun 's X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you 're clever But in general the answer is no However if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial GNU ghostscript from the FSF current version 2.5.2 includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2 10 How to

circle The approximation may look acceptable but it is sensitive to scale Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large If you want to do the job right consult the article A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications volume 9 number 9 September 1989 pages 48-56 For rough non-rational approximations consult the book Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt Ellis Horwood Publishers Halsted Press John Wiley 1980 For the best known non-rational approximations consult the article Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves by Tor Dokken Morten Daehlen Tom Lyche and Knut Morken in Computer Aided Geometric Design volume 7 numbers 1-4 combined June 1990 pages 33-41 Elsevier Science Publishers North-Holland 12 How to order standards documents The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards and also ISO international standards Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900 mailing address is 1430 Broadway NY NY 10018 It helps if you have the complete name and number Some useful numbers to know CGM Computer Graphics Metafile is ISO 8632-4 1987 GKS Graphical Kernel System is ANSI X3.124-1985 PHIGS Programmer 's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System is ANSI X3.144-1988 IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987 Language bindings are often separate but related numbers for example the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985 Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public this includes you ANSI can let you know where to order them most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179 13 How to FTP by email There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail In addition there is at least one FTP-by-mail server Send mail to ftpmail decwrl.dec.com saying help and it will tell you how to use it Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse 14 How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon If the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem see Eric Haines article in Glassner 's ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon If the sum is 2 pi the point is inside if the sum is 0 the point is outside However this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly Code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the Ray Tracing News Vol 5 No 3 available from princeton.edu pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z 15 How to tessellate a sphere One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles The base of the recursion is an octahedron and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones Jon Leech leech cs.unc.edu has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates It 's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu 16 Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography Highlights of this edition- i more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through November '91 ii papers from all Siggraph Graphics Interface Eurographics CG International and Ausgraph proceedings through December '91 iii all citations keyworded for easy lookup iv cross-indices by keyword and author v glossary of the 119 keywords used The bib is in the form of a PostScript file The printout is 41 pages long Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file It 's named speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z and is compressed at most sites- Site Dir wuarchive.wustl.edu graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/ karazm.math.uh.edu pub/Graphics/ gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au pub/papers/ nic.funet.fi pub/sci/papers/graphics coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics/papers/ Eric Haines erich eye.com maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies These are in refer format and so can be searched electronically a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu pub/Graphics/Papers as RayBib and RadBib.

about GIF GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms It is quite limited in some ways yes the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all and in fact I do n't like it much However it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where

image or object to another one Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph There are three files morph_intro.ps.Z PostScript version many pictures 1.5M morph_intro.txt.Z text version m_responses.Z Responses to morphing questions The files are compressed so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards 23 How to ray-trace height fields Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing They have a number of uses such as terrain

religion,soc.religion.christian,"This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a sharing on the Johannine hours as proposed each month by the monks of the ecumenical community of Taize pronounced te-zay in France NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP soc.religion.taize Unmoderated PURPOSE OF THE GROUP The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks based in France Many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly Johannine Hour which will be posted at the beginning of each month A Johannine hour involves a short commentary on a given Bible passage followed by some questions for reflection Any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here We are not interested in theological debate and even less in polemics No expertise is required The idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own life-journey The idea of Johannine hours was born in Taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible 's message in the midst of their daily life Because of work or studies it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods There in silence we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of Christ During the time of silence it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if in some Biblical expressions we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ The idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of Christ not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply Perhaps those who read and think about the Johannine Hours in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects the personal aspect of silent personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY The following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the Taize pronounced te-zay community A PARABLE OF COMMUNION August 1940 with Europe in the grip of World War II Brother Roger aged 25 set up home in the almost abandoned village of Taize in Eastern France His dream to bring together a monastic community which would live out a parable of community a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time Centering his life on prayer he used his house to conceal refugees especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY Taize 's founder spent the first two years alone Others joined him later and at Easter 1949 seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy Year by year still others have entered the community each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation Today there are 90 brothers Catholics and from various Protestant backgrounds from over twenty different countries Some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia Africa North and South America The brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves not even family inheritances and the community holds no capital The brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work In 1966 Sisters of Saint Andrew an international Catholic community founded 750 years ago came to live in the neighbouring village to share the responsibility of welcoming people in Taize TAIZE AND THE YOUNG THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS Young adults and less young have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since 1957 Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search Intercontinental meetings take place each week Sunday to Sunday throughout the year and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any one week The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity The meetings in summer can have up to 6,000 participants a week Three times every day the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church of Reconciliation built in 1962 when the village church became too small A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH The community has never wanted to create a movement around itself Instead people are called to commit themselves in their church at home in their neighbourhood their city or village To support them in this Taize has created what it calls a pilgrimage of trust on earth At the end of each year the pilgrimage has a European meeting which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for several days in a major city There have also been meetings in Asia and in the United States Every year Brother Roger writes an open letter to the young Usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year NOTE Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in news.groups For any further information contact

computer,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,After hearing endless debate READ name-calling over which os is better dos and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple of different operating systems I have decided to put the two products to a head to head test as so many fellow newsposters have suggested I have however no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY do what it says i.e run windows apps OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows apps in 386 enhansed mode something that most larger windows apps require but OS/2 2.2 which is supposed to be in beta test is supposed to I have heard that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp and I was wondering if anyone knew where to obtain a copy I would appreciate any information as I would like once and for all to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs

computer,comp.graphics,There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters The points x y z on a spherical surface with radius R and center a b c can be written as x-a ^2 y-b ^2 z-c ^2 R^2 This equation can be rewritten into the following form 2ax 2by 2cz R^2 a^2 b^2 -c^2 x^2 y^2 z^2 Approximate the left hand part by F x y z p1.x p2.x p3.z p4.1 For all datapoints i.c 4 determine the 4 parameters p1 p4 which minimise the average error |F x y z x^2 y^2 In 'Numerical Recipes in C can be found algorithms to solve these parameters The best fitting sphere will have center a b c p1/2 p2/2 p3/2 radius R sqrt p4 a.a b.b c.c So at last will this solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situations I think

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,Computers are a special case and it 's a pretty good idea to leave them on cuz everytime you turn on a computer you 're putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components Imagine you 're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day You 're increasing the chances of damaging the chips memory etc on all the components of your computer So you may save a few cents here and there in electricity bills but it won't look like much when it come time to fix your computer

religion,soc.religion.christian,My news feed is broken and I have n't received any new news in 243 hours more than 10 days So if you reply to this please send private email to the address esther demand.ed.ray.com I have set the Reply-To line to have that address but I do n't know if it will work It depends upon the software but generally I would n't expect reply-to to cause an email cc to be sent in addition to a posting You 'll probably need to do something specific which will vary depending upon your news software clh At any rate I need some support Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers I 've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs I 'm female Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I 've been sexually harrassed at this company Seven times Eight years Yesterday was the most recent one someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer I 'm really upset by this I suppose it could have been worse it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something There was no note I do not know if it was someone 's idea of an innocent joke that went awry someone 's sick idea of flirting an act of emotional terrorism that worked I dreaded coming back to work today What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question I do n't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff I can lock up my desk but I ca n't lock up every book I have in the office I ca n't trust that someone wo n't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I 'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body To make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30 I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch So I returned at 11:25 only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch They left at 11:15 or so No one could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my number was posted So I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor This despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer I need some prayers I ca n't stop crying I am so deeply wounded that it 's ridiculous I feel like I 'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act I feel like I 'm a sub-human piece of garbage that 's not worthy of a simple phone call saying We 're leaving for Mary 's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting Please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously turned into something positive Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop and find some healing for him- or herself Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions This company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment is n't tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven times in eight years in the same place Pretty words from the company do me no good when I 'm terrified or healing from the latest assault And please pray that I do n't turn into an automaton because of this That 's my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you 're not worth anyone 's time so do n't go talking to anyone about this you 're right you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this company so why ca n't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well what makes you think women are n't just possessions and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode please pray that these thoughts do n't come into my head and stay there triggering depression Please pray that this latest trauma does n't come between me and God In a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God and it 's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God I know God does n't drop me from his loving hand but it 's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand look down think I 'm falling and forget that God 's still holding on to me Although this probably is n't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence After all he 's allowed me the thermometer note and a few other off-the-wall topics Thanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers Peace to you Esther
computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,Hello I 've been following discussions on 17 monitors in comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good reviews I 'm interested in getting more information about Nanao 's products as well as some others that may fit the bill I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI I 'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor This monitor need not be large 17 if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above I 've been very happy with a 16 on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home I 'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun 's fairly often and look pretty good to me at least I have n't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic Ok stuff I 'd like to find out How can I get ahold of Nanao What are the products in their line What are the technical specs Esp what scan freq and max resolutions can they handle What 's list and street cost if avail from a third party and where can I get ahold of them Same info for Sony and Hitatchi Thank you very much

religion,soc.religion.christian,Is life a pass/fail course and does God grade on a curve I 'm new here and only vaguely religious but I want to know what some of you people think Specifically are there an infinite number of Heavens and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves Or is it simply Heaven or nothing Hell Also are we graded by those around us or has there always been some unchanging method Is the person 's childhood taken into account I 'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you but I figure that you 're the experts -Quinn Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree I suspect that 's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries and their writings tend to be highly symbolic However both Jesus teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation e.g Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement Also I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven but by the skin of his teeth as it were But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell and not all Christians would even go as far as that The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons and they are very far from mainstream Christianity far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations in addition to the Bible and Holy Tradition of a more generic Christian sort Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we could n't possibly pass If you like test analogies God grades on a very strict and unbending scale but he also cheats he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher before actually doing the grading Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell it 's easy to see why you 'd be inclined to think of it as grading While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details I think we all agree that in one way or another God cheats I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God 's cheating extends Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ but somehow still follow him in their hearts Many Christians believe that this is possible at least in principle but certainly not all do Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved but it 's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he 's going to place the dividing line Certainly he made it clear that we ca n't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not

Brown Secretary Department of Commerce 14th and Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington DC 20236 Dear Secretary Brown As you know I have long been interested in the privacy and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in a networked environment Recent reports concerning the Administration 's endorsement of an electronic encryption standard based upon clipper chip technology have raised a number of related issues The international competitiveness of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is a key factor that the government should consider when addressing issues of encryption and data security As the nation moves forward in developing the national communications and information infrastructure security of telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of users The hacker community can compromise the integrity of telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the network The people and businesses that use the nation 's telecommunications network and the personal computers linked through it increasingly are demanding that information be protected against unauthorized access alteration and theft I am concerned that the Administration 's plan may mean that to remain competitive internationally U.S. companies would be compelled to develop two products one for U.S. government customers and another for private commercial users who may want a higher encryption standard This may inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping to serve both markets To assist the Subcommittee 's analysis of this issue please respond to the following questions 1 Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA NIST or the vendor If so please identify such entities and the nature of testing performed If not please describe any plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how such experts will be chosen 2 Under the Administration 's plan what entities will be the holders of the keys to decrypt scrambled data What procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to designate such key holders 3 Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the Administration contain a trap door or back door which could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to crack the code 4 It is clear that over time changes in technologies used for communications will require new techniques and additional equipment How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid advancement of telecommunications technology 5 What additional costs would the proposed encryption place on the Federal government What is the estimated cost to consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard in their equipment 6 What is the Commerce Department 's assessment of the competitive impact of the Administration 's endorsement of the clipper chip technology on U.S. exports of computer and telecommunications hardware and software products I would appreciate your response by no later than close- of-business Wednesday April 28 1993 If you have any questions please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or Karen Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at 202 226-2424 Sincerely Edward J.

religion,soc.religion.christian,Mark Ashley 's account of private revelation does not as some might think contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church believes that public revelation on which Catholic doctrine is based ended with the death of St. John the last Apostle In that posting I made sure I used the word public Public revelation contains God 's truth intended for everyone to believe The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual He may speak directly to the individual He may send an angel or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations but doctrines can not When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention the Church may investigate it If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God it will be approved That means that it can be preached in the Church However it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations such as those at Fatima and Lourdes I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation it 's not something I need every day but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation Marty Helgesen Bitnet mnhcc cunyvm Internet mnhcc cunyvm.cuny.edu

politics,talk.politics.misc,This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good solution One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while Another approach is to try and amend the constitution The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years depending on just how one wants to count it The First Amendment though weakened in many ways still restrains government particularly state and local even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two not that I think that 's likely to happen Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism that it can not be stable That might be true but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again we would just be back where we are now This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus

religion,talk.religion.misc,In lsjc8cINNmc1 saltillo.cs.utexas.edu turpin cs.utexas.edu Russell Turpin I regard love as no more or less benign than any other Christian does You are merely expressing approval of the consequences I find therein Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my or any religion Love is a highly ambiguous word of which Christians can write both the gentle words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians in a passage that even the conservatives will quote at you and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note as will become more evident below blechhh I think you are misreading me rather seriously Though given my principle that one CAN NOT force one 's own notion of sin on another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism Russel Turpin and others believers and unbelievers alike are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love You misread I can do and have repeatedly done a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings in the first place and to respect for let alone love of God in near succession Please go back to my quoted words above The possibility that always exists is that I or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessors over the last several centuries could persuade Christian B of my case that the Inquisition does indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded By Christian argumentation as well as by secular both Christian and non-Christian prohibitions What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point A. I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved in the Inquisition B The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must however painful this seems discipline her children for their own good in this case the salvation of their souls or if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example deterring others from the same loss-of-soul A. I point out that this justification of a failure in love depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable B. Burns me at the stake My rhetoric has failed but the point I am making is sustained What is going on here has a lot to do with cultural baggage In this case the baggage includes a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture The elimination of Inqisitorial practice in those places where it has been eliminated or at least greatly reduced has very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B. Mr. Turpin is pointing out that if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor 's B then my persuasion is not very likely to work I know this and in what- ever personal agony I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney So one possibility fails in this case as it will fail in may others At the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it properly SHOULD not if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor And that is potentially an even more troubling case in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have accepted that they were in fact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them The point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and given the main thrust of the Inquisition against heresy it is bound to break down in precisely the worst cases The conservative I do n't think that is the right word BTW will take refuge in what I attribute to B above that he is justified in causing harm because he thinks that works to a greater good But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel as if one 's theories about sin entitled one to cast aside Jesus words on dealing with sinners cf Matthew 5:39ff I am a radical Christian only in that I take the gospel seriously Well the whole point of making these the base commandments is that they are n't reducible to rules A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies but not if they are used instead of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's actions The Great Commandment is more than anything else a call to act as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action A demand that I like most would rather not hear but it keeps popping up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this than succeeding at it Conservatives may twist this act as if you were God to mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they do n't keep YOUR rules They are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy IS how God acts That after all is the standard accusation against God by the atheists here and elsewhere That the conservatives have confused THEIR manipulative hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism and I quite agree with it on this point And different bodies of Christians have from the beginning urged different ethical systems or in some cases none As a result it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular or infamous with Christianity Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH It does not have a QU'RAN Specifically Christian scripture has very little if anything in the way of commandments so little that the Christians who desperately want commandments go mining for them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their efforts The one single thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson that I hope to get to in a day or so it is quite true that SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT I'll point out what has to be going on in these inferences and why there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved You are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical system But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again I think you are begging the question Why do n't I and the myriads of other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity Nor is this very new in Christianity you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers from the 17th century onwards and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case

politics,talk.politics.misc,Horrors appealing to popular principles Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles rather than as you appear to believe it was written with something else in mind and propoganda put out by its supporters But let 's be honest about something here When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments Or are they simply propogranda We ca n't know what Phill really means because he 's obviously using arguments designed to convince If they 're true or false regardles of why they were said why on earth did you make a point of calling them propogranda That would seem to be irrelevent Oh I have no argument with questioning them I do n't believe they no longer apply but that 's because I think most of them were good arguments I 'm not entirely happy about the situation because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system most changes in it would require Constitutional change In this particular case however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition It only should have been made part of the Constitution In principle no That they had less power of that they should have had less power Phill we 're discusing the power of legislative houses While the Prime Minister is member of Parliament he is more analgous although badly to the U.S. President Now please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is in principle more powerful than the House of Lords or the Senate but in practice is less Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution really intended for them to be more powerful but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they 'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in Not at all As any entry level political science course will tell you people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to attack which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want With national interest groups it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states Less people to persuade and less contributions to make Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension The same extends to insurance medicine and most other questions Local government has not failed in that it has n't done what it should but that it is dominated by local interests Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules ca n't get their rules past the local government Thus since they 've got more clout only in the wrong place they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower I mean let 's get real here Do we really need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern Or that carjacking needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime The more people want the more Congress will take power to sell it to them for their votes I do n't think the rise of special interests is coincidence with the increased power of Congress Bingo The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness Then why not simply leave New York 's education to New York I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that 's what they want to do And if you leave it to them you only have to worry about the pork in that state And since industries ca n't concentrate their political power and wealth rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want individual voices have more relative impact The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must buy off states but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork But why on earth should we want to redirect it You said yourself that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction the pork problem is significantly reduced The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action thus it the system is weighted against action Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing The difference with the lower pyramid is that a they have more legal legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government and b at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate And c you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once You get to see them tried out without a national decision Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole yet even with similar problems in different areas different solutions may be called for And while I often do n't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off I 'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents I 'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt Phill you brought up the Federalist papers We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this Which was when you brought up that we ca n't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers You argued against them I never argued from them I have primarily referred to the Constitution which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning There are a couple of other examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the reasoning for the power to grant permits both in Article I Section 8 To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it was n't intended However I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say Unlike most people I think we should n't be worrying about the veto which is fine but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse BUSH Phill that 's absurd Bush had 37 vetos one of which was over-ridden Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record Why not What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful When you 're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority Now we 're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill I do n't see how it make a difference Sure it 's arguable Theyr e arguing it However requiring 60 to bring it to a vote ensures that they 'll have to have a good argument Something that is n't based solely on party lines No I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for action Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about And 41 is hardly a tiny minority I do n't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the federal system against action
religion,talk.religion.misc,Question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists Stephen Tice the Cotera Joe Gaut et al apologies if I 've mislabelled any of you I 've only started reading t.r.m since the BD disaster But I know the Cotera is a fundy and are defending Koresh and his beliefs as an example of True Christianity under persecution from the the Big Bad Secular State what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits If the reports are accurate what IYO does this say about the quality of his Christianity Or are the allegations just part of the Big Cover-Up I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire I wouldn't put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself On the other hand if the propane-tank-accident story is correct I would n't put it past the FBI to try to cover its ass by claiming Koresh did it I hope your government does a VERY thorough investigation of the whole debacle and I 'll be disappointed if a few heads do n't roll The authorities seem to have botched the original raid and in the matter of the fire are guilty of either serious misjudgement or reckless endangerment

religion,soc.religion.christian,My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman about twelve years ago We 've kept things on a painfully polite Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time Attempts to see each other end disastrously with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her or his inattention or insensitivity to her I mean this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal He seems from what I've seen to live in a state of quivering anxiety hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests Now this is his choice and I need to accept it even if I deplore it But it 's hard From time to time I 've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship by cutting off contact or trying to have a real if painful relationship by talking honestly with him but I 've always thought Why be dramatic And you know he 'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone Just leave the door open in case he ever decides to come back It 's been an unsatisfying choice to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship but it was the best I could think of Now this weekend my mother finally decided that she was n't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother blaming her for everything wrong in their lives and in which my brother evaded temporized claimed the situation was beyond his control and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions Mom said she would not that she would not quietly take abuse any more and that if these were the terms of their relationship she did n't want to talk to or see them any more And she hung up I have never seem my mother lose her temper and I think that this is the first time she 's ever hung up on someone Mom says she feels as if she 's divorced my brother and that it 's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with I have mixed feelings I 'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her for being jerks for persisting in such a wretched life which hurts us all and is warping their children angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he 's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable emotionally disturbed woman pained for their children who are a mess scared for the future since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they ca n't get away with treating us or each other this way and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others misery and finally mostly sad sad sad to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible destructive situation that they ca n't see a way out of or they ca n't bear to take whatever paths they do see And I 'm frustrated because I do n't know what if anything to do and doing nothing drives me up the wall I try to pray about my own feelings of rage impotence and vindictiveness and about their situation but I am not free of the desire to DO something concrete The desire to DO something to define a problem and fix it is one of my besetting vices I 'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me Is this a time to reach out to my brother To let things be How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him Here 's the big question I 've been evading throughout this long long post Is it ok as a Christian and a proponent of faith hope and charity to accept the destruction of a relationship To give up on my own brother or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens Do please answer by e-mail or post Thank you

religion,soc.religion.christian,Despite my trendy liberal feminist tendencies and the fact that I basically agree with what you are saying I will rebut The basic question here is how do I know what I am supposed to do This is true in every situation that comes up Some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses I claim that is just as dangerous as following authority I could site sexually transmitted diseases drug abuse all manner of criminal activity the savings and loan scandal car accidents eggs thrown at my house all are examples of people not following authority I could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the problem was a leader not following _his_ authority and doing what he wanted Of course where is the top of the chain Therein lies our search I do n't think it 's as simple as you are claiming Pressing need is ambiguous Should I recycle or not Realize that I have four kids who despite being very precocious of course are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding the tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them Ahh An ironic ending The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper sticker cliche Question Authority was that I was questioning the authority of the person telling me to question authority It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different only in rebelling forsaking everything for the sake of freedom I question their integrity and fortitude There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly Different people are at different levels of development in different areas Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow we ca n't know everything about everything Often when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher perhaps blindly Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should I question him only when I have developed my skills enough should I challenge him Once again how do I know when I get to those stages If you have to be told to question authority perhaps you should n't

religion,soc.religion.christian,Well despite what my mother told me about accepting dares here goes You have to be very careful about what you mean by question authority Taken literally it is nonsense That which is authoratative is authoratative and to say I question to word of this authority is ridiculous If it is open to question it is n't an authority On the other hand it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority The catch phrase here should be authenticate authority Once you have authenticated your authority you must believe what it says or you are not treating it as an authority The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy You can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse But the fact that I can not discredit something does not in inself accredit it Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false I can not accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings because if I can independantly verify its teachings I do n't need an authority I need an authority only when there is information I need which I can not get for myself Thus if I am to authenticate an authority I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves Every scientist woring today assumes on the authority of the scintific community all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself In spiritual matters we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation We select our authorities based on various criteria I am a Catholic in part because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief unless we simply made something up for ourselves as many do The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities This is a reasonable assertion in itself but it leads to a practical difficulty If you reject all authority out of hand you reject all possibility of every receiving information Thus the atheist position can never possibly change It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific To demand scintific or rational proof of God 's existence is to deny God 's existence since neither science nor reason can in their very nature prove anything

recreation,rec.sport.hockey,"The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period but Kevin Dineen 's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win 7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night Roster move Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch Lines Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill Tommy Soderstrom Game Summary Say if anybody from Buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems We had to turn down the volume The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left Eric dropped it to Galley and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone Mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik skated around him and in on Fuhr Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick Recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18 It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage The game then became a defensive struggle for a while The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone LaFontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play Mogilny got a post after it was over The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play The best penalty killing team in the league did n't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play but they could n't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged This was considered a rebuilding year after The Trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season went When asked if he agonized over The Trade he said that it was Russ Farwell 's trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money But yes there was some agonizing and they 'd do it all over again When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it 's Russ call and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season He feels that they 're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup He expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer He 's very happy with the re-alignment he called it outstanding Happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started but eventually did Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle He half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot Fuhr did n't know where it was though and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15 Then Mogilny on a breakaway He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom He went with the backhander but Soderstrom was all over it The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at 4:22 The Sabres coudln't get started Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way It started out a 1 on 1 but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40 That was all for Fuhr John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over But the Sabres still had lots of power play time Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them Boos began to ring through the building But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it Mistake 1 he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A the rebound or B Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net Well the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom and mistake 2 Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie He did n't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away With the goal at 7:48 two streaks end for the FLYERS 150:28 of shutout hockey and 27 straight penalty kills Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor I think it was Barnaby again This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly but could n't get too much quality on goal The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended Things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff The gloves were dropped and McGill started pounding the crap out of him But during the fight he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty 2 for slashing 5 fighting and 5 for the major 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15 Barnaby only got 5 The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that After a couple of good Sabre chances Audette handed to Ledyard at the point and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2 LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone but Hasek was strong Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season Ironically the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles That was all in the 2nd shots were 19-7 Sabres Into the 3rd period and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back A 2 on 1 Acton with the puck he dropped to Eklund in the slot and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from When he finally did shoot he hit the far post That was still during the carryover power play time Than an incredible almost goal Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom Soderstrom goes down Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net Red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers But up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing Well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35 The FLYERS could not get anything going at all They finally got set up 1/2 way through but were kept on the perimeter As time ran out Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him Dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at Hasek and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42 4-3 FLYERS But the Sabres came right back LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net Erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net Mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through Soderstrom 's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4 Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55 The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone and stayed there Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek 's glove side at 6:44 Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19 The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it and Rod got the puck He backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen 7th of his career 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play Not much action on the 4 on 4 and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves The Sabres were n't able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS would n't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday That was all the scoring shots were 18-13 Buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who had n't been tested much in his last couple of starts Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but I do n't think so The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury 4 points out of 4th clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker A couple misc notes Forget the Mike Keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman The Times of Trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma has looked over Tommy Soderstrom 's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year His response was that he wants to come back he feels he did a good job this year but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell did n't want him back FLYERS team record

religion,talk.religion.misc,I think that you are changing the meaning of values here Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word value n. 1 A fair equivalent or return for something such as goods or service 2 Monetary or material worth 3 Worth as measured in usefulness or importance merit 4 A principle standard or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable 5 Precise meaning as of a word 6 An assigned or calculated numerical quantity 7 Mus The relative duratation of a tone or rest 8 The relative darkness or lightness of a color 9 The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound In context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best In terms of scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing In my mind to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach Science has its basis in observable fact Even the usages of the word value above do not denote observable fact but rather a standard of measurement I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values and so your statement above fails In fact if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements values are based on systems derived from observation then it must follow that in a scientific context there is no such thing as there is no such thing as objective values Back to the present This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow Just because the word values is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts If one is to argue for objective values in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective Considering the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen So back to the original question And objective morality is If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will be a good beginning

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,stuff deleted Actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw or whatever the instruction is called is quite efficient single instruction goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus Since the 286 was n't cached the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance and it 's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles for 'computing as does the 'rep insw sequence The floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer as was done on the PC Jr by the way really does stink

religion,alt.atheism,False dichotomy You claimed the killing were not religiously motivated and I 'm saying that 's wrong I 'm not saying that each and every killing is religiously motivate as I spelled out in detail Which killings do you say are religously motivated For example I would claim that the recent assassination of four catholic construction workers who had no connection with the IRA was probably religously motivated At the time of writing I think that someone who claims the current violence is motivated by religion is reaching What would you call is when someone writes The killings in N.I are not religously motivated I 'd say it was motivated by a primitive notion of revenge and by misguided patriotism Otherwise I 'd have to wonder how come mainland catholics are not killed by mainland protestants and southern catholics are not killed by southern protestants and so on Take away all plausible causes bar religion and the violence diminishes markedly Gee why _is_ that Now it 's possible to argue that religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in the present but I do n't know of any evidence that this is so and I'm not enough of a historian to debate it Given that the avowed aim of the IRA is to take Northern Ireland into a country that has a particular church written into its constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated by that Church I fail to see why the word past is appropriate The country also has a different official language written in its constitution and vice versa maybe they 're motivated by a love of Irish poetry Your argument is fallacious jon For what it 's worth I agree with all that you say about Ireland above and more
science,sci.med,As has been noted before there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_ No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated and the replications do indeed reproduce the result No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed and reasonable knowlegeable people agree with the force of the logic But people try experiments and pursue arguments for all sorts of crazy reasons Irrational motivations are not just curiousities they are a large part of the history of science There are a couple of negative points to make here 1 A theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi For example quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics with no direct verification What would be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other I would n't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi though I do n't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi 2 Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence Most experiments are carried out and interpreted in pre-existing theoretical frameworks The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done Overall there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and which computations get done What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science results do n't count unless they can be replicated The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test The generate part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properly Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed that when you separate them by handedness you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid Pasteur 's irrational motivation had led to a replicable and important result This is where Lysenko creationists etc fail They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything When their theories do predict and are contradicted by experiment they do not concede the point and modify their theories rather they try to suppress the results Lysenko or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position creationists

politics,talk.politics.misc,From baba Tymnet.com Duane Hentrich -BTW I 'm a WALC white aryan lapsed catholic -d'baba Duane M. Hentrich baba Tymnet.Com I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan The word Aryan is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture the Rigveda It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for indo-european but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that aryan is synonymous with nordic which seems highly unlikely The people who originally called themselves aryas the Iranians Noprth Indians the Afghans and possibly the Kurds are none of them nordic So the use of the word by Westerners though meant with apparent good humor in this case is nontheless inappropriate The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans by descent are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda If you want to check what I am saying look at Mallory 's book In search of the Indo-Europeans or just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim

Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948 According to that information Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh about 50,000 people These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem published by Cambridge University Press Is this book available in your library 8 You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim I wonder how many and where There is very little evidence available about that As much as I know many Arabs are working for kibbutzim even for many years but are not accepted as members Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs 9 My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority Your answer is not satisfactory I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments"

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Actually this is incorrect French resistance may have played some part in hindering the German war effort however the crucial role was supplied on D-Day Interesting statement Especially when you consider that Lebanon had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks as well as Israel Of course one of the prime obstacles to Israel 's complete withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which have not been asked to withdraw as well
religion,alt.atheism,my stuff deleted Bill you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its sole purpose the validation of atheism It does n't This board is used to discuss atheism as a philosophy to share posters experiences regarding atheism to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole to share resources relating to atheism and even to socialize with others with similar views And of course with the number of theists who come here to preach it is also used to argue the case for atheism If you want to accuse people of lying please do so directly The phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are Christianity and Islam Both of these claim to make their followers into good people and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths IMHO they are right The American Friends Service Committee Quaker Catholic Relief Services Bread For The World Salvation Army soup kitchens and Mother Theresa spring to mind Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names of some analagous Islamic groups When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her Christianity I believe her Her form of theism ascribes to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need The point is that such a philosophy does have the power to change the behavior of individuals if it is widespread enough it can change societies The same works for the horrors of history To claim that Christianity had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute What it seems you are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that religion has had no evil impacts on history That is absurd

politics,talk.politics.guns,Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE AUTHOR 'S NOTE Adrian name changed to protect the guilty and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous New York publishing house Dear Adrian I 'm way behind schedule on my current book again so this reply to your note criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and generally attacking gun ownership will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you 're free to believe or not I can back with evidence and logic I 've neither time nor energy to present now I 've written fully on this topic before and will again in the future When I do I 'll make sure you get copies There are many arguments I might make from the futility and danger of delegating self-defense to the police see Don Kates in the Jan. 10 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL to the real effect of prohibition shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs but I 'll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note First the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility Second publication of some latter-day scientific study does n't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my interview annoying you so much in the process were lying Third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility Fourth as often happens with these things the study does n't support the gun prohibitionists original numerical contentions anyway but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies omissions and distortions Fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility Sixth the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions Carl Bakal author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS even confessed to it publicly makes the value of this present study dubious to say the least Seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility Eighth given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction you should be better aware than most people how progress in designing studies to prove whatever you want outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data A case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create studies proving that pornography causes crime More naive and probably more honest efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary Ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility Tenth another reason to doubt all such studies is that human behavior as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified The attempt to do so and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information is wrecking our civilization Eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility Twelfth the study is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometimes with ancillary social benefits If anything perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a criminal offense Thirteenth and finally the National Rifle Association officials quoted in the article whatever their shortcomings and they are many are correct in this instance the study is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and Constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility And because of that Adrian even if the study were valid it would n't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody 's permission In this I 'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun while they still can Before the '68 Gun Control Act most of the shooting fraternity viewed handguns incorrectly as it turned out as inaccurate ineffective toys There probably were n't six million of them in the whole country Now thanks to Kennedy Metzenbaum the Bradys and their ilk AMERICA 'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM we probably manufacture at least that many every year The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control et al are perfectly aware of this so I guess you 'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are Look gun-making is n't an arcane or difficult art and by the way it 's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self-loading pistol is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further Even if it were difficult there are already a quarter billion firearms in America with an estimated half life of 1000 years possibly more for stainless steel Guns are gon na be around a long time Adrian whether you like it or not As for me to paraphrase Elmer Keith regardless of what the law provides or any court decides I 'm always going to be armed And I will always work to see that others are as well The bad news is that there are thousands more perhaps even hundreds of thousands where I come from We ca n't be stopped by passing laws we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics perhaps more efficiently So what 's the point L.

religion,soc.religion.christian,Many pagans are involved in environmentalism this is only natural since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations This does n't mean that environmentalism is wrong any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it Nonetheless paganism is certainly on the rise and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity Like it or not pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be and is n't I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten This does n't mean that paganism is right but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement First paganism respects the feminine Christianity has a long history of oppressing women and many if not most male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner The idea that God is sexless or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission is met with a great deal of resistance This insistance on a male-dominated theology and the male-dominated society that goes with it drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches Second paganism respects the physical world This is an idea with great ramifications One of these is environmentalism respect for our surroundings and our world Another is integration of sexuality Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality This is too much sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic and paganism is an attractive option I 'm not advocating that Christian doctrines no sex before marriage etc should be changed just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality and neither one does much to bring us closer to God

religion,talk.religion.misc,My online Bible is on a CD but I do n't own a CD-ROM system for the time being so I ca n't search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly states that he did n't want to break existing Jewish laws In other words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday as their holy day if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus Cheers Kent
religion,soc.religion.christian,If I get a chance I will ask them this weekend The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem A quick look does n't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies Let me make one point The clash between Jeremiah and the false prophets was primarily in the theological realm The false prophets understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's descendants came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David 's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet He was from Anathoth across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory When he came to prophesy he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of Solomon His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies The judgement prophesies were deeply loaded with theological meaning In my opinion both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson New York will burn prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies Bill Rea o o -w U w

recreation,rec.motorcycles,IMHO in my humble opinion I did n't say there was no value all I said was that it is very confusing to newbies Bill you are kidding yourself here Firstly motorcycles do not steer themselves only the rider can do that Secondly it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and not the knowledge of physics between the rider 's ears Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise Formal training in this country as far as I am aware does not include countersteering theory I found out about countersteering about six years ago from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist I did n't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing and realized he was right It 's an interesting bit of knowledge and I 've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it who were at first as sceptical as I was But that 's all it is an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster or better as a result is absurd Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you 're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn And that was my original point

science,sci.electronics,A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer although many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such Strictly a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state according to the inputs A demux on the other hand uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal So there are three inputs required A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input since this can be used as the data input e.g when high all outputs are high when low only the selected by control inputs output will be low An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit bit 2 to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled Thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits Note that this method can not be used to create a true eight way demux since you have no data input the enable line on a four way decoder left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four four-way decoders plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time Therefore use the fifth decoder attached to the two high order bits to provide the four enable lines Of course the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders Please give me the credit when you submit your homework JohnH Electronics Department School of MPCE Macquarie University Sydney AUSTRALIA 2109 Email johnh mpce.mq.edu.au Ph +61 2 805 8959 Fax +61 2 805 8983

science,sci.med,I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly My definition is this Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous Unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition I hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about Consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about One can read this definition and still not know that 95 of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc In short knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about The misunderstanding here is my fault I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition I agree on both counts As an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls As to the first I do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable The latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others It is perfectly alright to speculate I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds This is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy On the other hand I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research As Gordon Banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation 's Rhine I think this is absurd I wonder why the results were not published In my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished This certainly eases one 's defense Finally I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology I know little about either and so have nothing to offer

If your workstation runs the X window system you 're in luck You can buy a cheap used PC hook your expensive keyboard up to it and run a serial cable to your workstation Then run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events The two main programs I 've found to do this are KT and A2X a2x is a sophisticated program capable of controlling the mouse and even moving among widgets on the screen It requires a server extension XTEST DEC-XTRAP or XTestExtension1 To find out if your server can do this run 'xdpyinfo and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list If your server does n't have this you may want to investigate compiling X11R5 patchlevel 18 or later or bugging your vendor kt is a simpler program which should work with unextended X servers Another program called xsendevent also exists but I have n't seen it Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu 2 X terminals Also a number of X terminals NCD Tektronics to name a few use PC-compatible keyboards If you have an X terminal you may be all set Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an

politics,talk.politics.guns,I 'll point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment process was to require a super-majority to change the Supreme Law making it impossible for a majority of the people to simply change the law on a whim Simply changing the meaning based on the representatives of the people effectively destroys the amendment process The State 's you know are also entitled to a say under that process I 'll note that that right could be considered protected under the first amendment 's protection of peaceful assembly Unless you would consider a militia inherently non-peaceful then they've stated the same thing twice
religion,soc.religion.christian,Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain things before the world i.e. publish them widely These things sacred to Himself He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary Moreover there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld 1 After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter James and John to tell the vision to no man until the Son of man be risen again from the dead Matt 17:9 If we were living at the time of Savior there would be no public record of this event 2 A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of paradise when he heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter 2 Cor 12:4 This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians and us 3 There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by babes were forbidden that there should not any man write them 3 Nephi 26:16 the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM 3 Nephi 26:16 Behold it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together and they both saw and heard these children yea even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from the world but it could be something else There is much we can discuss about the temple ordinances We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment the ritual However there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone including other saints outside of the temple As a portion of the endowment we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven I must keep this knowledge sacred and respect the conditions under which it is revealed to me
politics,talk.politics.misc,I must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government 's handling of the Waco situation as gun supporters Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing gun nuts and just mixes up two issues I am one of the BATF/FBI critics and yet I am a liberal and just as anti-gun as you are I just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies They 're all human beings not some nest of wasps that you 're trying to exterminate The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid It was well known that Koresh regularly went jogging outside his property He could have been served with a search warrant then He could have been arrested if he had refused to comply Instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property This escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides Those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no-knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served At this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis That 's when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident etc Things were already building up to disaster Now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited But according to Janet Reno that option had never been seriously considered So supposedly because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go in Now it 's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible for the fire If that 's so he deserves the blame for the deaths of the people in his compound But the government 's hands are far from clean Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus contempt for the 4th amendment The motivations for the second raid are just too unbelievable And their coverup of the events of the first raid undermines their credibility in anything they do thereafter We have only some very biased FBI agents word for what happened And please let 's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun discussion Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents And Koresh 's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal illegal illegal-but-should-have-been-legal or whatever
politics,talk.politics.misc,Excellently put Even as a libertarian I have to admit government does do some things I like There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft. Lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars I do n't know how much was private and how much was stolen I mean public but it is beautiful and I enjoy it Keep in mind though most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it However I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis In fact we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi pro-choice pro-life or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis Not so with economic issues Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge but not the bus lines or the lawyers Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise But there is no hope in my opinion of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an efficient manner I call it political market failure Thus if you value freedom and the abundance it produces you have to swallow the whole libertarian agenda

Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth file system Or leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files DOS system files for instance Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage unit of a cluster there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system Now you have a situation where no encrypted data appears on your disk at all

science,sci.space,In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix For example the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum structure The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it In other words if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum then froze it this is what you get It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant Dani Eder

politics,talk.politics.guns,A handful of anti-gun zealots are telling the public that their right to self-defense is of less importance than the interests of Handgun Control Inc This action comes as local state and federal law enforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidian compound an assault which has already resulted in the death of one two year old child at the hands of federal agents This has highlighted the need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children against the excesses of their own government Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a distortion of the facts at best The aggressive outreach by officials in central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in the level of assault and rape in that area Of course this program is a rare gem as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an unarmed citizenry will be easier to control and thus favor tighter restrictions The vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large who are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their lawful affairs The entire country knows how vulnerable the average citizen is both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our own police Texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have shown total understanding for those innocent law-abiding citizens on the front lines and the families of those who have fallen I urge the House of Representatives to pay attention to the needs of their constituents and not be stampeded by ill-conceived arguments from ideological fanatics Ai n't propaganda fun

science,sci.crypt,I ca n't answer all our questions in detail but I can take a stab at them The form the operations that compute R1 R2 and R3 is of course the famous triple encryption suggested for use with DES It 's much stronger than a single encryption and has an effective key length of 160 bits For reasons that were discussed when DES was first standardized a simple double encryption would not have the same strength Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less the beginning to encrypt other keys It 's recommended for anything of very high value And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit that description Why n_1 n_2 and n_3 Well you need different plaintext values I have no idea if they 'll be disclosed or not At a guess they're constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit patterns and there might conceivably be a weakness So the n_i values are and I 'm guessing chosen to increase the Hamming distance In any event I 'm quite convinced that one can not go back to the S_i from the U_i let alone U Observe if the NSA has U they don't need to find S_i But even if they do they ca n't get U_1 and U_2 In theory they should never even see those values even with a warrant The real question I think is why use this scheme at all as opposed to a hardware random number generator My answer is that this is much more verifiable Look suppose that NSA NIST the ACLU the EFF and the NRA combined to build a really good random number generator and that it passed every test you could think of When you come back next week to program some more chips does it still work that well Have any components changed in value Have the components been changed out from under you Does it still work well the in the presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards selecting 1 bits Yes you can run detailed statistical tests on it again but that 's hard Consider on the other hand a software solution You bring your own floppies with you you can run cryptographic checksums etc It 's a lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged in other words Yes I can think of ways to cheat software too I think that they're a lot harder There are three issues with Clipper The first is whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working My answer with one significant exception is yes I really do think that NSA and NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping under certain carefully-controlled circumstances with a minimum risk of abuse The exception is that U exists outside of the chip on a programming diskette That 's seriously wrong U_1 and U_2 should be loaded onto the chip separately To those who disagree and I don't claim my answer is obvious though I found my own reasoning sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions section of my technical analysis paper I had originally blasted the scheme I issue this invitation assume that you were charged with implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and due process What would you do differently In answering this question please accept NSA 's fundamental assumptions that both strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap some domestic users is necessary If you feel it necessary to challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue I present below Right here I 'm discussing just the technical aspects And no I do n't by any means claim that just because something can be done it should be The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually going to be used Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't mean that that 's the only way they 'll be made Maybe the NSA will substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the shipping dock And they 'll generate bogus warrant requests so that the escrow agents do n't wonder why they 've never called Sorry guys all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have bought triple-DES phones instead Who 'd a thunk it I have no answer to this question and at the moment I do n't see a way of answering it Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer to the final question below The third and most serious issue is whether or not Clipper is a good idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law I think that the answer is no but it 's not a no-brainer I 'm a civil libertarian not a libertarian for reasons that I explained at great length on the net in the Elder Days and that I do n't have the energy to repeat now But that means that I 'm willing to accept that some laws are necessary so long as they respect the essential rights of individuals The government already has the ability and in our system the right to issue search warrants and while that power has certainly been abused it 's also been used quite properly and fairly in other cases Is key escrow sufficiently different I think so but again it 's not an easy question for me It is easy for libertarians to answer of course since Clipper is completely alien to much of the rest of their oft-admirable philosophy And it 's also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government a group I 'm much more distant from

science,sci.space,Why not build a inflatable space dock If you 're doing large-scale satellite servicing being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense The question is whether anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near future to the point of justifying development of such a thing That 's a mighty fine idea But since you asked Why not I'll respond Putting aside the application of such a space dock there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume Temperature control is difficult in space and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation maybe a double-walled inflatable Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required Do n't think this will be a clear plastic bubble it 's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today Because almost all manned space vessels Skylab Mir Salyut used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity even though they had have metal skins they still kind of qualify as inflatable The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials due to temperature extremes monotomic Oxygen impingement and radiation effects on materials so your fabric may not retain any flexibility for long This may not matter Even after inflation pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success Ken Jenks NASA/JSC/GM2 Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov 713 483-4368

religion,soc.religion.christian,As far as I can see one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus 's disciples Basically they gave up a lot career possibly family and well a whole bunch to follow Jesus So what is the difference It is quite plain Jesus was good and David Koresh was not The problem is I think is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles For instance there are thousands of laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not Often it is hard to bring people to justice because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it If only we could trust judges to be just then we could tell them to administer justice fairly and justice would be followed But since judges do n't always get it right we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect the justice of man into something perfect But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented So we might consider a ranting Christian to be bad but an eloquent person from another religion to be good This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs even if it allows people to do bad things I think that it is the message that is important If a man is presenting a false message even if he is ever ever so mild mannered then that man is performing a tremendous disservice I know that I am rambling here I guess that what I am trying to say is that we should n't be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong It is not wrong to follow and worship a person But it is important to choose the right person It is simple Choose Jesus and you got it right Choose anyone else and you got it wrong Why Because Jesus is the begotten son of God and nobody else is Jesus was without sin and nobody else was
politics,talk.politics.guns,This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list Hi Folks Wednesday marked day 2 the beginning of the trial Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense each side presenting its version of what happenned last August The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the evil federal government The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents sawed off shotguns and later failed to appear for trial Despite repeated good faith efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully Weaver refused The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing According to the prosecution three people were taking an offensive action against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace They wanted simply to be left alone Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun and did not as the prosecution alleged want to become a regular supplier The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he would n't become an informant it is not specified explicitly but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story We 'll know more as things develop The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver 's dog that was in proximity to Weaver 's son Samuel Weaver then fired in self-defense In the ensuing battle federal agent William Degan was killed when his gun was later found there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic However agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire this will have to be more fully explained Finally the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to look at the body not recover of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper Prosecution quote Weaver wanted that confrontation and he made that confrontation Asst U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist Defense quote The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they did n't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit Gerry Spence nice soundbite Notes The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday 's protests outside the courthouse However the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including Tim again Tim claimed he was a skinhead who were ordinary working class people He also claimed he was for white pride not white power Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_ about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action and to perhaps learn something from him Some tidbits Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him Spence during his 90-minute opening statement repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife 's death and Spence compared the sawed off shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 another good one Today Thursday April 15th the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence Drew

religion,soc.religion.christian,No It is very relevant Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are topically aranged together in the law This is very important Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deals with temple prostitution and I think you would agree that there is no proof for this If the Law reveals the character of God and is holy just and good as is written in the New Testament then those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts to be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human adult relationships Is n't that bordering on sophistry The point we are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly I do not have problem with a loving nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex I have them and we all do The issue at hand is the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex or lusting after So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation And the idea that these relationships may be emotional relationships between adult humans is red herring We all agree that it is okay for adults to have caring relationships with one another

religion,soc.religion.christian,Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man This was precisely my point From a theological bent those who lived immediately after the flood such as Noah Ham his son Cush and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath They also had a stronger understanding of the True God In fact this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some so much so that Atlas who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance and thus he became the Elevator of the heavens This god made men able to feel as if heaven were afar off and as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws It is interesting to see that it was that was titled Emancipator or Deliverer or Phoroneus It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind yet was worship for having given many benefits He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer One delivered from a conscious feeling of God 's wrath the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true I do n't see the problem From the time of Adam those who looked forward to the coming Anointed One and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision were accounted as righteous But up to the Crucifixion their sins were only covered not taken away Therefore the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same but see it as a completed action Rom 's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else I understand what you 're trying to convey but I do n't think I 'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of say the Church ruling with Christ Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness It depends upon your def of lost The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world Existentially we were all born lost but the righteous were in Christ and therefore never assuredly lost Maybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it I simply have to buy more books for myself and these older books are very expensive Either that or countless trips to the oriental museum Could n't agree with you more Our understanding of say eschatology is clearly clearer than that of say Isaiah But that is not what I was referring to No I understand it as you have said This was my point Ah This is it This is the big question However I would say again I think that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it Look at Satan 's twist of God 's Word when he coerced Eve That is a very interesting study The similarity in the midst of great variety of Yes that is my point But it is a two edged sword For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed They were not known as mystery religions for no reason There was the public side of them and there was the private side that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light The Mystery of Iniquity that we find in the Bible correlates to this I think The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion Case in point today might be the Masons Just a note that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt who can be traced to Nimrod the husband son No I disagree with you here Gerry I know what you 're alluding to in that the church primarily the RCC did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece If you are a student of history you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God See if you can find Wilkinson 's Egyptians He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they pilfered from the Egyptians I 'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker Its just that there is nothing new under the sun

politics,talk.politics.guns,jrm gnv.ifas.ufl.edu Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area It would not be economic to smuggle them in All production would have to be local There are not all that many people who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such but the average person and average thug would be lucky to get a zip-gun and would pay through the nose for it Good point you make However a zip gun by definition is a crude homemade gun certainly not something capable of sustained accurate fire but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun Recall the tiny single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans They were essentially well-made zipguns incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns Also note that the crowd-pleasin favorite the Sten gun was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible The point 's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing hand tools and a welder I still think that while the point is good I think there 's a difference between marijuana and firearms in that quality marijuana can be grown locally there 's no need to import the stuff If guns are banned I think the demand for real guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible thus rendering a ban moot In any case the result would be the same people who are n't criminals wo n't have firearms and bad guys will continue to have access to them one way or another And I do n't see that as a necessary situation
science,sci.electronics,One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies you 'd have 330 Hz per channel sampling rate That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth Obviously this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws govern the use of transeivers in your location

politics,talk.politics.misc,I 'm afraid that I 've lost the thread here I did n't suggest that all government regulations be subject to referenda So I do n't follow the comments above I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate Furthermore I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort No I 'm not surprised I just think it 's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government e.g Iraq Yup sure do But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare Article I section 8 I 'm willing to justify such programs on that basis Well in the first place I do n't support a socialized economic system I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea But it is not the case that any third party is as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example jsh

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,Hi peeps Here 's another of those any ideas type queries I 've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy without a keyboard But no problem so far When I dismantled it I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked sort of The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines The display rolls continuously but does change modes OK only to CGA but useful for my laptop Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors I 've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC at least in the UK DEC said sorry Phillips do n't make it any more What is it anyway A UK support dealer said Circuit diagrams Sync So any ideas John
computer,comp.windows.x,I think your performance will depend upon the X server I 'm running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM 8MB swap and it runs just fine Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals in the labs at school anyway You could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal Linux/X setup for 900 and be better off than with an Xterminal IMHO Scott
politics,talk.politics.misc,Once again Mark you do n't specify the means through which the government is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests As a left-wing big government conventional liberal I 'm just as willing as you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto dealers But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents terms to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws and a desire to eliminate legislator 's pay Each strikes me as a particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special interests can not influence public policy In fact they seem clearly designed to accomplish the opposite jsh

religion,soc.religion.christian,Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral other than Leviticus So far when I ask around here I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians have n't seen any stonings in a _long_ time Later Max Bob Muir The list was posted not long ago as I recall aside from Lev commonly cited passages are the story of Sodom Note however that this was a homosexual rape and there 's no disagreement that that is wrong I take an intermediate position on this note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness It does n't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality Rather I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins However from what we know of Jewish attitudes homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible homosexual rape of guests who were actually angels But this story is not specifically about homosexuality In the NT the clear references are all from Paul 's letters In Rom 1 there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil Note that the passage is n't about homosexuality it 's about idolatry Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment or at least result of idolatry There are a number of arguments over this passage It does not use the word homosexuality and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality So it 's not what I 'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality The other passages occur in lists of sins in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 Unfortunately it 's not entirely clear what the words used here mean There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning such as wanton and that another may be specifically male prostitute Again we do n't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT 's negative judgement on homosexuality Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited however it 's probably not relevant The context in Jude involves angels Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels it seems likely that strange flesh refers to intercourse with angels As you can see the NT evidence is such that people 's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible Conservatives note that the passages from Paul 's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement Liberals note that there 's no specific teaching and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel This is an explosive topic which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words But it's clear to me that that 's mostly irrelevant What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel This appears to depend upon one 's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole as well as one 's perception of the needs of the church today This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses That makes things very frustrating for a moderator who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely
miscellaneous,misc.forsale,I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT Walkman having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer and am paying more for However it 's still a heck of a machine for the price it is quite rugged and many people out there swear by it It 's probably the most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there Anyway the guy selling it is Bryan Davis bdavis netcom.com and here 's what he told me Here is what is included TCD-D3 DATman 2 RCA to Stereo 1/8 plug cables One for analog input one for analog output Optical digital I/O cable one lead for input one for output A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase The unit is still under factory warrantee AC adaptor/battery charger Rechargable battery I paid 750 tax for it so I hope you do n't mind if I keep the 60 minute tape it came with I have some samples on it By the way he spent at least 100 too much for it unless he 's including an extended warranty which is advised for DAT machines since it costs about 300 to replace the head when it wears out and it probably will within 5 years if you use it a lot davisonj I 'm not going to quote my sale price for him that would not be nice Send him mail and ask him what he wants Again I 've used the TCD-D3 and I have to say that I can certainly understand why it is as popular as it is I 've been using one for a little while and although I had some problems with it recently I should also point out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been _used_ during that time This is the same exact DAT machine that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy for their recent live album I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in S.F who use that model and have been for a while with no reported problem My problem is that everyone I know already has one 'nuff said The reason I 'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical I do n't have any optical ports on my equipment but you the reader might and it also has some other bells whistles that the TCD-D3 does n't I am also paying more for the alternative Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are available if you absolutely must have one Of course it has SCMS All consumer decks do So do Sony Minidiscs by the way Anyway if you 're interested get in touch with bdavis netcom.com

religion,soc.religion.christian,The cited passages are covered IN DEPTH in a FAQ for this group That particular FAQ I 've forgotten the author discusses the traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and indicates which points have strong textual support Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for retrieving the FAQ on this topic BTW this issue while dealt with before is VERY timely One of the major Presbyterian churches in California St. Andrews a MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood is withholding their support of Synod amounts to about 10 of the budget of the Synod which covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii until support for a pro-homosexual lobbying group the Lazarus Project is terminated This came from a news report on CNN yesterday corrections welcome Tim I think it 's time for me to post the FAQ This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church On the other side one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do so And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said they could n't install a homosexual pastor has made her an evangelist These situations as well as the one you describe do not appear to be stable This will certainly be a major topic for the General Assembly next month If the church ca n't come up with a solution that will let people live with each other I think we 're end up with a split Clearly neither side wants that but I think we'll get pushed into it by actions of both sides

politics,talk.politics.misc,THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April 15 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room 9:45 A.M. EDT Q Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed MS. MYERS Just due to scheduling conflicts So as we put out the President will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden as opposed to 10:00 a.m The only other things on his schedule today are At 11:00 a.m. he 'll meet with General Vessey who as you know is on his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue At 12:30 p.m. he 'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval Office And at 2:00 p.m. he 'll meet with the police organizations Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he 'll do his weekly photos with the various groups Q A photo op with Vessey MS. MYERS There 's no coverage on the Vessey meeting Q Why MS. MYERS Why It 's a closed meeting Q What about the lunch MS. MYERS The lunch No there 's no coverage Q Is he meeting with any congress people today MS. MYERS Nothing scheduled Q There are no meetings MS. MYERS There are no congressional meetings today no Q Has the President been given any information by the Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from Hanoi Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the Vietnamese on that subject MS. MYERS Well clearly the report is the first order of business It 's high on the agenda on something that they 'll discuss I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to Vietnam today but the President has n't drawn any conclusions about the report yet Certainly it 's something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese about first Q Did the President talk with any Republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package MS. MYERS He spoke with Senator Dole Q How many times MS. MYERS I believe once during the day and once last night Q What was the outcome of that MS. MYERS They 're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package Q Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any way flexible on this MS. MYERS Well I think we 're hopeful that we 're going to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate and we 'll continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement Q Did they discuss the VAT tax MS. MYERS I do n't know if that came up Q Can you check that MS. MYERS Sure Q So what are they is the President offering to scale down his program is that what he 's trying to do buy it down to where Dole will sign on MS. MYERS Well he 's trying to protect as much of it as he can But it 's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the Senate and through Congress now And as soon as we reach some conclusions on that we 'll let you know But at the moment he 's continuing to consult with members of Congress including obviously Senator Dole Q Is he talking to anybody else MS. MYERS I do n't believe he talked to any other Republicans yesterday Q Is he talking to anybody today MS. MYERS I do n't think anything is scheduled but I would n't rule it out Q We were led to believe that the President called Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package Is that correct MS. MYERS I think the President has contacted several people on Russian aid I think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with Senator Dole The primary objective of the conversation was Russian aid That was the first order of business but it was both Q In the President 's mind are they linked politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to the American people Has he made that argument MS. MYERS I ca n't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made The President is obviously committed to both He liked to see a jobs package to the American people first But as you know we outlined the details of additional Russian aid last night in Tokyo Q But does the President believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for Russian to accept a vote for Russian aid MS. MYERS I think that the President is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package to pass a jobs package and we 're still hopeful that we 'll get some kind of jobs package through the Congress Q Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating now with Dole MS. MYERS He 's discussing options with him Q On the stimulus is it your understanding that over the break some Democrats themselves have left the support that they had earlier for the package the stimulus package MS. MYERS I think we still have wide support in the Senate for the jobs package Q But specifically that you 've lost Democrats other than Shelby MS. MYERS I do n't believe so There has n't been a vote Q What about Kohl Q Kohl and Feingold MS. MYERS There has n't been a vote yet And we 'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of the members of the United States Senate support the package Q If you 're were n't worried about Kohl and Feingold why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day MS. MYERS I think George pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded or to lose funding if this jobs package does n't pass Q No Democrats Laughter MS. MYERS I 'll let you draw your own conclusions Q Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any other Republicans again today MS. MYERS There 's nothing specifically scheduled but again I would n't rule it out Q Does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today MS. MYERS What we 've done is we 're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state I think it 's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up we 'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package Q Will you share those with us MS. MYERS Sure As we did yesterday Q Do you have copies of the ones you sent MS. MYERS Yes we made those available yesterday And we certainly can continue to provide them today Q Dee Dee since yesterday 's questions and subsequent stories about the VAT what further consideration of this issue has been given MS. MYERS Nothing 's changed since yesterday I think the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on and I do n't think we have anything to add to that Q But he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it Can you tell us MS. MYERS I think that there has been I 'm not going to speculate on who supports it I think the President said that there has been some support among business and labor groups I do n't think he said he was directly contacted by them Q Are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this MS. MYERS I think there 's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently but I do n't think I want to add to that Q In February though the President said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road What has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind MS. MYERS I think as we said yesterday it is something that the working groups are looking at They 're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the President 's health care plan The President has not taken it up yet has not made a decision on it And beyond that I do n't have anything to add Q You have n't answered the question It was n't being considered by anyone in the White House after the President 's comments in February and George reaffirmed that in a briefing Q And then suddenly Q What happened MS. MYERS The working groups as we have said throughout we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across-the-board And one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added tax Q But the President himself took this off the table Dee Dee and suddenly it reappears And this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way What has happened in the meantime MS. MYERS The President has not looked at this it has n't been presented to him again yet The working groups are looking at it as they 're looking at a wide variety of options and no decisions have been made Q And it raises the question of how independently the task force is working MS. MYERS The task force was instructed to consider all options and they 've taken that mandate seriously and they 're considering all options Q But that 's not the impression that the President left in February The impression he left was that this was something that was long-range to be looked at 10 15 years down the road The clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table not an option Q If it changes I 'll tell you Q Bring him on Q And you repeatedly referred to the President 's remarks telling us that those were still in operation MS. MYERS It 's changed and we told you Laughter Q But that 's what Alice Rivlin 's comments and Donna Shalala comments were about I mean that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers MS. MYERS I would n't no Alice Rivlin 's not a Cabinet member first of all Second of all it was not orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it 's something that 's being looked at We confirmed that yesterday And I do n't have anything to add to that Q Is it because he has very few options Q Is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the President about In other words has the President himself personally ruled it out and it 's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table Or is it in fact back on the table having been placed there by discussions with the President MS. MYERS It is not the working group 's mission at this point to convince the President of anything It is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options I think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that context and at this point he 's not that presentation has not been made but it 's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on Q They will present it to him as one of his options though he specifically ruled it out MS. MYERS Correct Q Dee Dee is this more than a trial balloon Is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation MS. MYERS It 's simply a statement of fact The working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform One of the options that they 're looking at is the VAT Q Dee Dee when the working groups were examining this possibility was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not MS. MYERS I do n't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is I do n't know Q Who was telling you that it was not under consideration MS. MYERS I was referring back to the President 's comments Q Have they discovered that the sin taxes wo n't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package MS. MYERS No there 's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan Q I 'm asking whether the projections MS. MYERS There 's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured You ca n't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like And so you ca n't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know Q Dee Dee we 've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages MS. MYERS Correct Q The question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package That is not a very difficult computation MS. MYERS It is a question that you know that we 're not going to answer until there 's a number of options being considered It depends on how the package is structured The exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made Q And when the President has been meeting with health care his health care advisors which we are told he has been doing MS. MYERS Correct Q they have never once said to him these are your funding options including the VAT He has never heard the word VAT in his MS. MYERS I am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily they 're not daily but the quasi-regular briefings Q Well you have MS. MYERS I have not other than to say that he 's not considered the VAT And I think that is a true statement Q No but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option MS. MYERS Correct Q That does n't mean he has n't heard about it MS. MYERS I 'm not going to get into the details of what 's discussed I think that statement stands for itself Q specific Dee Dee When you say he has n't looked at it do you mean that he has n't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage or has n't looked at it in general Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works what the advantages are the whole thing It sounds like MS. MYERS But that was I think in Chilicothe if you go back to his remarks there it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure And I think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan But clearly it 's something that he 's thought about in the broad context I mean that was clear in Chilicothe What I 'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it 's something that he has n't considered yet It 's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options and that no decisions have been made And I 'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed Q It 's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place You say that no option that the option has not been presented to him MS. MYERS That is correct Q Do you stand by does the White House still stand by George 's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal MS. MYERS No decisions have been made We have nothing to add to what 's already been said Q Let me follow up here Do you stand by what Rivlin said yesterday that if any kind of VAT were to be used or considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive MS. MYERS I 'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if Q But do you stand by the previous conversations in February that if there were to be a VAT I think the President said you 'd exclude food and energy MS. MYERS I 'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that has n't been made Q Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala 's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups MS. MYERS I do n't know specifically what Q Could you check for us because that 's a real important credibility question MS. MYERS Sure Q Since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money Were you all kept in the dark Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you 've been denying that a VAT tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option MS. MYERS I think we 've said all that we have to say It is something the working groups are looking at The President has not made a decision about it yet And beyond that I have nothing to add Q Well sorry Dee Dee there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here yours primarily What we 're asking is if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not or if it 's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us MS. MYERS I do n't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium ever ever Q Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something has anybody told anybody to come out MS. MYERS We 're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody I 've said what I have to say about this issue Q All we were trying to find out MS. MYERS I understand what you 're trying to find out and I 've given you the answers Helen Q We 're trying to find out what changed what made it an option again That 's the MS. MYERS The working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options and they are doing that Q Yes but it was n't an option before How can you investigate it if the President has taken it off the table MS. MYERS It is something that they 're obviously considering and the President has not made a decision on Q Yes but he took it off the table in February MS. MYERS Working groups are considering it They 'll present it to the President at some point and he 'll make a decision Q Why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table MS. MYERS It 's clearly on the table Q Yes but he took it off the table Did he change his mind MS. MYERS It 's back on the table Bill Q Did he change his mind MS. MYERS He said this morning that he has n't made a decision about it He obviously knows that it 's on the table It 's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we 'll let you know Q So he must have changed his mind right MS. MYERS At some point it will be looked at I mean Q Dee Dee there 's like two options either he changed his mind or the working groups think they 're authority exceeds the President 's MS. MYERS The working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options they 've done that Q Are you going to put out his income tax MS. MYERS Yes there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon His return will be available Q Will there be any kind of briefing to go through it MS. MYERS No nothing 's planned I think someone will be available probably not in a briefing setting but to walk you through the questions Q We 're used to be walked line-by-line through the presidential tax forms MS. MYERS I 've seen those briefings Laughter Q Could we have one MS. MYERS No I do n't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it Q Did they file a joint form MS. MYERS Yes Q When did he file it MS. MYERS I believe it 's being filed today Q Dee Dee is there going to be a backgrounder for Miyazawa MS. MYERS No there will be a readout after the meeting Q No backgrounder today MS. MYERS No backgrounder today Q This is complicated stuff We need help Laughter MS. MYERS We ca n't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in one day it 's too confusing Laughter Q Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of force in Bosnia They 've both said that A they never ruled it out and B it might be necessary now Does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach MS. MYERS There 's been no change in our policy towards Bosnia We have always said that we 'd consider Q But does that impact upon your decision Are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you MS. MYERS They 're people whose opinions carry weight certainly I mean the President supports the process that they 've initiated But there 's been no change in our policy for Bosnia although we 're considering a number of options right now If the Serbs do n't come back to the negotiating table if they do n't sign on to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options which we 've been saying regularly Q One follow-up question then We can not get a straight answer from anyone in the administration Why do you not set a deadline for the Serbs Can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table MS. MYERS We 're continuing to put pressure on them every day Q Which does n't work so MS. MYERS Well we think it is having some effect We 're going to continue to tighten sanctions As you know we support the omnibus resolution We expect that to come to a vote on the 26th Q You say it 's having an effect can you give us any documentation MS. MYERS I 'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that Q There 's been no you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in Bosnia Serbia yes in Bosnia no MS. MYERS I think that they 've had effect in Serbia and we think they 've had some effect in Bosnia And again I 'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if you 'd like Q We would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in Bosnia We had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade but we have n't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting Can you provide something along those lines MS. MYERS I will see what I can get you Q On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced this morning where is that money coming from MS. MYERS We 'll have to work with Congress on the details of that package Q So that would be new money that you would hope to get MS. MYERS Yes that 's new money in addition to the 1.6 billion announced in Vancouver So I assume that you all have seen the 1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in Tokyo by Secretary Christopher Q Is n't there a concern though about offering something which you have to get in Congress I mean that was the concern with Vancouver you did n't want to do that MS. MYERS The concern with Vancouver was to do something immediately which required money that was already approved in the Fiscal '93 budget What we 're looking at now is a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the 1.6 billion that we announced in Vancouver This clearly will require congressional approval or some of it will anyway and we 're going to continue to work with Congress to make that happen Q To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by Congress MS. MYERS The President has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward Q Was Christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through Congress MS. MYERS It was created in consultation with Congress Q In meeting with the law enforcement officials is that does that have a set speech and a goal A direction MS. MYERS Yes the President will talk about and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President 's jobs package They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do Q Who are they MS. MYERS It 's members or leadership from three organizations NAPO which is the National Association of Police Organizations IBPO which is the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations I believe and IUPA which is the International Union of Police Associations Q Will the FBI chief be there MS. MYERS The FBI chief No Q Or any other federal law enforcement officials MS. MYERS No it will be the President and these national law enforcement organization leaders Q Does the 1.8 billion announced today include the 400 million that 's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament MS. MYERS No The Nunn-Lugar money is separate Q So this would be the 700 million that 's in the budget already plus another 1.1 billion MS. MYERS I believe all of this is on top of the 700 million already in the budget Q Is this going to be part of the supplemental or Fiscal '94 MS. MYERS We 'll work with Congress on the exact funding mechanism on exactly how this will be paid for Q This 1.8 billion on top of MS. MYERS On top of 700 million on top of the 400 million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier Q And this is what prompted the President to call Bob Dole it was on this tranche not on the previous money he was calling Bob Dole MS. MYERS Correct Q Is there a briefing on Miyazawa MS. MYERS There will be a readout after the meeting with Miyazawa Tomorrow Q Dee Dee on a totally unrelated matter some Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House and the Chamber of Commerce There are the town hall meeting the other night the satellite and all of this relationship Does the White House feel that you 're getting too close to these Chambers of Commerce MS. MYERS That 's an interesting charge Laughter After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the Chambers now there are those who would accuse us of being too close I think that 's interesting But no we 're thrilled by the support we 've received from the national Chamber and local Chambers across the country and we 'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives Q What 's the status of the President thinking about going to this Democratic retreat MS. MYERS It 's on his calendar I think he 'll almost certainly go Q All three days MS. MYERS We have n't figured out exactly when he 'll be there yet Q Is it open to coverage MS. MYERS No I believe the whole thing is closed Q Is he going to have any kind of address statement anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th MS. MYERS We 're still looking at that We have n't made a final decision about how we 'll who will make a statement or what Q Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders MS. MYERS Nothing is scheduled but I would n't rule it out Q What about an AIDS czar MS. MYERS It 's coming Q Anything on the weekend Q There 's been a suggestion that he 's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march MS. MYERS No I think this is something he 's been discussing for a long time appearing at the Senate Democratic retreat Q The weekend MS. MYERS Weekend Do n't know the only thing on right now is the radio address on Saturday Q Any travel plans MS. MYERS If it changes none right now Q He 's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package MS. MYERS No specific plans right now Q What about mid-week Anything likely MS. MYERS It 's possible Yes I think it 's likely that we 'll travel next week certainly the weekend Q Has he called Thurmond about his daughter MS. MYERS I do n't know I 'll check Q Going to name a drug czar this weekend MS. MYERS This weekend I do n't believe so Q And the radio address on Saturday is that going to be focused on the stimulus package MS. MYERS I 'm sure it will THE PRESS Thank you

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Subject RE Europe vs. Muslim Bosnians From f54oguocha Date 13 MAY 93 02:28:53 GMT Serbs 1929 Islam not who Croats has childhood was You 've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity They speak Serbo-Croatian But there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by changing religion See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls the people i.e Christian slavs For this reason the war-criminals call all the Bosnian Muslims Turks even though they are not ethnically Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language For this reason what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically identical but religiously other is called paradoxically ethnic cleansing rather than religious cleansing Thus while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of WWII and older agenda the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from Bosnian is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war Regards Mike

religion,soc.religion.christian,According to what I have read on Biblical idioms speaking in X's name is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney A person from Jesus culture authorized to conduct business in John 's name had full authority over John's financial affairs but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John 's benefit and consonant with John 's wishes It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with in John 's name it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of faith With this cultural background praying in Jesus name does not mandate a particular verbal formula rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous fiduciary relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom The message of praying in Jesus name is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards both resources and responsibilities This idea of praying in Jesus name is not only present but prominent in the Lord 's Prayer although the verbal forumula is absent The act of praying the words In Jesus Name may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God 's Kingdom For that reason I 'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning Prayers to God for other purposes desperation anger thanksgiving etc do n't seem to be in this category at all whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian whether B.C or A.D. that 's B.C.E or C.E for you P.C I do n't see anything in Christ 's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace Van Kelly vek research.att.com

religion,soc.religion.christian,Peter White writes You 've missed on very important passage 2 Thess 1:6-10 For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day and to be marveled at among all who have believed for our testimony to you was believed Things to note from this passage Unbelievers are both those who openly reject the gospel and those who do not know God The eternal destruction is the same as the eternal hope in 2:16 This distructions primarily emphasize that it is separation from the presence of God THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent while 2:1 is speaking of the rapture Do n't confuse the two Yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven For instance If this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to ignite However there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning bush that was not consumed Also the Daniel acct shows that the laws of nature can be interupted even with earthly fire Maybe you do n't understand There will be those who are alive at the end of the millenium who will walk straight into the GWTJ Even those who have died in their sin will be resurrected i.e reunited with their physical body to receive condemnation This is contrary to the teaching of Scripture THis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the no physical body thesis The true awlfulness of hell is that it is eternal separation from God after having seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ But whether it was open rebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known GOd not saught Him as He is then as Paul says they are without excuss and that every mouth will be stopped There will be no defense at the judgment seat of God THerefore we understand it is appointed unto man once to die and then comes judgment literally just because it is horrific does n't make it less of a reality it should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with others

religion,soc.religion.christian,a lot of stuff deleted For that matter stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet The Feast of First Fruits Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week Sunday by any other name in modern parlance Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it Why seek after unbiblical methods In fact that is the reason Easter jumps all over the calendar Passsover itself is a lunar holiday not a solar one and thus falls over a wide possible span of times The few times that Easter does not fall during or after Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox- the beginning of spring more deletions So what does this question have to do with Easter the whore goddess I am all for celebrating the Resurrection Just keep that whore out of the discussion Your obsession with the term whore clouds your argument Whore is a value judgement not a descriptive term more deletions Overall this argument is an illustration of the etymological fallacy see J.P. Louw _Semantics of NT Greek_ That is the idea that the true meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form In fact our own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with how it is _used_ not where it came from Very few modern people would make any connection whatsoever between Easter and Ishtar If Daniel Seagard does then for him it has that meaning But that is a highly idiosyncratic meaning and not one that needs much refutation

file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717 THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April 16 1993 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government engineers The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key-escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney General Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key-escrow system the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace and the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information This infrastructure of high-speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet The provisions of the President 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology 301 975-2758 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations A No Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans Q Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device What would they have to do to decipher the message A They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system Q Who will run the key-escrow data banks A The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks Q How strong is the security in the device How can I be sure how strong the security is A This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities Q Whose decision was it to propose this product A The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials Q Who was consulted The Congress Industry A We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative Q Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them Q Who provides the Clipper Chip A Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future Q How do I buy one of these encryption devices A We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices Q If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices A This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the U.S. saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either-or proposition Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques Q What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration A It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism Q Will the devices be exportable Will other devices that use the government hardware

religion,alt.atheism,And that of course is the point You ca n't simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity and have nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion But once you start talking about behaviour then someone 's suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are I assume worried about And in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and easily led on the other I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led Whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point

recreation,rec.autos,Hi I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi Galant GS transmission The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission Since the car was bought new while shifting from 2nd to 3rd unless I do it SLOWLY and carefully it makes a popping or hitting sound The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service reached by an 800 say this is NORMAL for the car IS IT And about a year ago at 35Kmiles the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse 1- The shifter would not budge The clutch had no effect 2- The front tires would not budge even when the clutch is fully depressed 3- If the clutch is released the engine would die 4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was stuck I could not make the car move It acted as if it were in Neutral except for dying when clutch is released 5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter 6- The shifter acted normally after that When this happened I took it to the dealer they checked the clutch it was o.k They checked the transmission it was o.k I had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again last week The dealer says there is nothing they can do because Mitsubishi the 800 says they have never heard of the problem and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car In all three occurances the car was parked head first in a garage and since the front wheels were stuck the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter hence temporarily solving the problem And the dealer and Mitsubishi refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission shifting from 2nd to 3rd and getting stuck at random but I ca n't get the dealer to fix it I need your help with the mechanical problems and with how to handle Mitsubishi All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated and sorry to bore you with the long post

science,sci.med,I 've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays In the examples I 've seen drugs were definitely involved My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital He was fifty-three at the time and he was on 21 separate medications The family protested but the doctors were adamant telling us that none of the drugs interact They even took the attitude that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well With the help of an MD friend of the family we had all his medication discontinued He had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug Two days later he was his old self again I guess there are n't many medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions I saw the same thing happen to my father and I can more or less validate your take on hospitals It seems to me that medical science understands precious little about taking care of the human machine Drugs are given as a response to symptoms and I guess that makes sense since all the studies that validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow assessment of the degree of particular symptoms But there seems to be very little appreciation for the well-being of a person outside of the numbers that appear on a test I watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital There is something a little crazy about a system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue It is really really bizarre
religion,alt.atheism,about my reply It a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming Usenet diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through is n't it Kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little about algorithms Your reasoning as I see it is very much along the lines of Roger Penrose who claimed that mathematical 'insight can not be algorithmic in his book _The emperor 's new mind Concerning computers minds and the laws of physics_ However Penrose's claim that he _has_ mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusions We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints I try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realising that it might not be anything special but certainly useful Thinking back of what I wrote do you think worms have minds or not They are able to experience pain at least they behave just like that Yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of C. elegans from the elements Would such a worm have a mind This is true to some extent However I do not think that our brains work like computers at all In fact there is substantial evidence Skarda 1985 Skarda Freeman 1987 that brains work more or less chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators I suppose Indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain I suggest however that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms Kevin take a look at the references I mentioned and think again I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are conscious The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion can not lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different And please do not bring QM into this discussion at all not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics I would say it does n't Again _brains are not computers_ Do n't forget this This does not mean they need something else to work they just work differently Their primary 'purpose is perception and guidance of action self-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances You are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green in our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical This is not how I see it The sensation 'green is a certain time-dependent pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex and it is distributed with the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain Indeed a firing pattern I have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns but this is just idle speculation Scientific American 's September 1992 issue was a special issue on mind and brain Have you already read it from cover to cover There are two articles on visual perception so you might be interested But again please note that subjective experiences can not be observed from a third-person perspective If we see nothing but neuronal activity we can not go on to conclude that this is not the mind Kalat 1988 writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the patients state of mind For instance a patient whose septal area was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations when the patients have started flirting with the therapist In conclusion there is evidence that 1 brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage 2 conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in various areas of brain when we think of colours our visual cortex is activated etc 3 consciousness is an afterthought we become conscious of our actions with a half a second delay and our brains are ahead of our 'conscious will by at least 350 ms Thus I think it is fruitful to turn the question Why do I see colours around and ask What is this I that seems to be observing since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains This depends on what is meant by 'seeing colours Does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 see the numbers if it is capable of sorting them If you are asking why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who does n't I have a good answer read my previous posting where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally so that they do n't unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons A bit extreme but this is the basic idea When early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools a sense of identity and the concept of 'self had to evolve in line with this development Indeed respect for others and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals such as early humans If minds are required for this does this mean that until human minds came to the scene wavefunctions never collapsed but remained in the superpositions for aeons My how powerful we are This has been discussed before and I think this topic is irrelevant since we do not agree that minds are necessary and neither do physicists I agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems It 's OK if you do n't forget to take with you the references I wrote about in my previous posting plus

science,sci.crypt,The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project I 'd like to add that I was not in any way involved I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening April 15 Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16 The document below is the result of that effort Dorothy Denning THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning April 19 1993 INTRODUCTION On April 16 the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the Clipper Chip together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys Two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key CHIP STRUCTURE The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called Skipjack The algorithm uses 80 bit keys compared with 56 for the DES and has 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 for the DES It supports all 4 DES modes of operation Throughput is 16 Mbits a second Each chip includes the following components the Skipjack encryption algorithm F an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N a 30-bit serial number U an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the AT T telephone security device as it will be Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device After pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end in general any method of key exchange can be used The key K and message stream M i.e. digitized voice are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values E M K the encrypted message stream and E E K U N F a law enforcement block The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N all encrypted under the family key F. CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF secure computer information facility which is essentially a vault The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips About 300 chips are programmed during a single session The SCIF is located at Mikotronx At the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2 These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers To generate the unit key for a serial number N the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1 S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 producing a 64-bit block R1 R1 E D E N1 S1 S2 S1 Similarly N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed R2 E D E N2 S1 S2 S1 R3 E D E N3 S1 S2 S1 R1 R2 and R3 are then concatenated together giving 192 bits The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2 The rest are discarded The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2 U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies As a sequence of values for U1 U2 and U are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1 The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values The third disk contains the unit keys U Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk The third disk is used to program the chips After the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the NSA CIA FBI or any other law enforcement agency One or both may be independent from the government LAW ENFORCEMENT USE When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F. This gives them E K U N. They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2 U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U and E K U is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI

politics,talk.politics.mideast,G-d has nothing to do with it Some of the land was in fact given to the Jews by the United Nations quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab absentee landlords Present claims are based on prior ownership purchase from aforementioned absentee landlords award by the United Nations in the partition of the Palestine mandate territory and as the result of defensive wars fought against the Egyptians Syrians Jordanians et al First I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the idea that the West Bank is theirs Since however I agree with those who claim the West Bank I think I can answer your question thusly the West bank was what is called the spoils of war Hussein ordered the Arab Legion to attack Israel which was a poor move seeing as how the Israelis promptly kicked his butt The territory is therefore forefeit Retaining possession of ALL of the West bank is not desirable but it beats national suicide for the Israelis Put another way one could ask why it is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them and the future state of Palestine As long as this state of affairs continues it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea Giving up the entire West Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint In addition there is the small matter of Jerusalem which is considered to be part of the West Bank The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil Even leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude like Yossi Sarid are n't going to propose giving up Jerusalem If he did he 'd get run out of town on a rail

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,For the second straight game California scored a ton of late runs to crush the Brewhas It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings but Orosco Austin Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday How 's this for numbers Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro 's ERA is 0.75 The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14 Ouch It does n't look much better for the hitters Hamilton is batting .481 while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI The next highest is three The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn who has the team 's only HR at .238 Another ouch Looking at the stats it 's not hard to see why the team is 2-5 In fact 2-5 does n't sound bad when you 're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game Still it 's early and things will undoubtedly get better The offense should come around but the bullpen is a major worry Fetters Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year Lloyd Maldanado Manzanillo Fetters Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place The starters will be okay the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen is a big question mark In other news Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal Today 's game with California was cancelled

science,sci.med,There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill. That 's the point after all That 's because these peer-reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people they 're looking at animal models You ca n't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans Note that I would n't have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in humans This is precisely NOT what you said It most certainly is for neurotoxicology You know studies of glutamate involve more than food science So point us to the studies in humans please I 'm familiar with the literature and I 've never seen any which relate at all to Olney 's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons Well actually they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine it 's a essential amino acid They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood Goodness I 'm not saying that it 's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods It 's just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like We 're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you 're misrepresenting it as received wisdom You mean asserting You 're being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you 're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other Olney 's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that 's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons It says nothing about MSG 's contribtion to the phenomenon of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab Probably one of the dumber remarks you 've made

religion,soc.religion.christian,Hello I just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country I am not sure if it is going on also here in the US or any other country In all these 4 1/2 yrs I 've been here in Illinois USA I have not encountered it May I just call it Traveling Fatima since I do n't know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language For certain regions in a district in a town or city an image/ statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home originating from owner to another This will stay with that family for one 1 week and this family is required to pray the rosary and other prayers prayer sheets accompany the image to our Lady of Fatima The move will be like a simple procession of folks picking up the image from its current 'home after 'departing' prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the prior notification about the move There will be the 'receiving' prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image there It does not have to be that only members of the family in that home who must pray to the image They may invite others or others/friends can invite themselves in to participate during prayer time in that 'new home everyday for one week This image is moved from one family to the next within the bounded region of that district until it goes back to the owner of the image This is probably going on around there Philippines right now or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot and every year this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more likely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image then is just moved next door I am thinking of starting something like it in the village where my sister and her family lives Most of our friends and neighbors there are Catholics and practicing ones I 'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this practice will violate whatsoever before I go for it Thank you for any comments or help about this matter

religion,soc.religion.christian,etc I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul 's illustration about one body many parts far too narrowly It is easy to say that the one body represents a particular sect of Christianity generally our own and the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry There is a place for that But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide variety of doctine Catholic Protestant liberal conservative Orthodox etc I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the context of the 'body of Christ And I am equally sure that one day after we shug off this mortal coil when we no longer see through a glass darkly but see clearly face to face we will all be ashamed at some of the things we held as truth We ought all fellowship worship and serve where we are called and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone else is called One of the fathers of the reformation help me out ca n't recall the name put it quite succiently In essentials unity In nonessentials liberty In all things charity While I agree with Lewis Mere Christianity that calling oneself a Christian implies some basic fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean anything at all I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit too broadly deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those bounds and ignore the requirements of charity all together Me I attend a Vineyard church speak in tongues am effectively an inerrantist though I 'll grant some inaccuracy in translation am moderately pre-mill and evangelical But I 'm not ready to damn those who use icons say mass in latin uphold the Virgin Mary though I really do n't believe that she was sinless vote on Church membership or insist on baptism for salvation Of course I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him studying His word and fellowshiping with others in the often extended family I read much of the night and go south in the winter T.S Eliot The Waste Land s.w marlatt Prov 25.2 University of Colorado marlatt spot.Colorado.edu 492-3939 National Center for Atmospheric Research marlatt neit.cgd.ucar.edu 497-1669
religion,talk.religion.misc,Wrong about what I think they are correct in thinking that a well-placed bomb or six would get headlines but I think they are wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a Buddhist Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like the Chinese occupiers Every action is its own reward On the other hand people who are aware of the occupation are mostly full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up with it And what does it cost us to admire them Zip Yes they are and whether this serves them well or not depends on whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence And without political independence can they preserve their cultural and religious traditions The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists just as the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements as terrorists Better off in what way As proponents of pacifism or as proponents of political autonomy And better off in what time-scale The Soviet Empire practised cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities some of which resisted violently and some of which did not but in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least some of the minorities survived Now some of the minorities are fighting one another Is that because they have to or because violent resistance to an oppressive Empire legitimized violence

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Let me improve this one for you then For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation The persecutions culminated in 1914 The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland After one thousand years Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye Today x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia Today x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland On this occasion we once again reiterate the unquestioned justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide render reparations to the Muslim people and return the land to its rightful owners The recognition of the Genocide has become an issue which can not be delayed further and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide adopts the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures to the contrary As taxpayers of the United States we express our vehement protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued coddling protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet Armenia Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia 's Source From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne by Avetis Aharonian The Armenian Review Vol 16 No 3-63 Autumn Sep. 1963 pp 47-57. p. 52 second paragraph Your three chiefs Dro Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian are the ringleaders of the bands which have destroyed Tartar villages and have staged massacres in Zangezour Surmali Etchmiadzin and Zangibasar This is intolerable Look and here he pointed to a file of official documents on the table look at this here in December are the reports of the last few months concerning ruined Tartar villages which my representative Wardrop has sent me The official Tartar communique speaks of the destruction of 300 villages p. 54 fifth paragraph Yes of course I repeat until this massacre of the Tartars is stopped and the three chiefs are not removed from your military leadership I hardly think we can supply you arms and ammunition it is the armed bands led by Dro Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian who during the past months have raided and destroyed many Tartar villages in the regions of Surmali Etchmiadzin Zangezour and Zangibasar There are official charges of massacres Serdar Argic
religion,alt.atheism,That 's funny I thought you were making a statement about what people think In fact I see it quoted up there
politics,talk.politics.mideast,I will try to answer some of Dorin 's questions even though they were not addressed to me specifically but I feel that I am a bit concerned by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of Israel 's bombs In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth It seems to me Dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon I am I was back in my home village this last summer For your information we are PEOPLE not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee Is that so hard to imagine It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc SOME young men usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians Once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an 8 year old girl just happened to be We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that if you 're gon na hurt our soldiers you 're gon na pay the price We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers Israel 's retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw The people of South Lebanon are occupied or shelled by Israel on a regular basis We do not want to be occupied If Israel insists that the so called Security Zone is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers If Israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from OUR land We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border I have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled This is the only realistic solution it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called Security Zone before the conclusion of the peace talks Such a move would save Israeli lives advance peace efforts give Israel a great moral lift better Israel 's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon I agree only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CAN NOT be qualified as murder no matter what you say I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make Yes we have no quarrel with Jews or Israeli civilians The real problem is with

religion,soc.religion.christian,I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally but decided to post the information I had on the topic I spoke to the pastor of my parish Catholic recently by coincidence on this subject His explaination was that while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest it is important to have it recognized by the Church as soon as it is possible Because the Church recoginizes itself as a community of believers members of the church to some degree are to be held accountable to each other To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis Therefore couples get married without the priest being present but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community Thus married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married as divorce sets a bad example for the community Also the couple has vowed to become one with one another the community should be able to rely on that couple to be as one While couples may marry without witnesses they may NOT get anulments without a priest present An anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not in fact a marriage at all for whatever reason So do n't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex whether or not they intended to be married assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents Sex IS a commitment I believe in God 's eyes But I 'm digressing God be with you

religion,soc.religion.christian,cont Dr. James DeYoung 3 R. Scroggs Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a Hellenistic Jewish coinage perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology The term is derived from Lev 18 22 20:13 where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos male and koiten bed and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar lying with a male Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term but borrowed it from circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions 180 n.14 It was invented to avoid contact with the usual Greek terminology 108 If this is true Scroggs observes it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it It was meaningless to native-speaking Greeks 108 Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part thus differing from Boswell 's learned discussion 107 Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of one who lies with a male to have a very narrow reference With the preceding malokoi I Cor 6:9 which Scroggs interprets as the effeminate call-boy arsenokoitai is the active partner who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires 108 Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic model of pederasty It certainly can not refer to the modern gay model he affirms 109 This is Scrogg 's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also The combination of pornoi fornicators arsenokoitai and andrapodistai slave dealers refers to male prostitutes males who lie with them and slave dealers who procure them 120 It again refers to that specific form of pederasty which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes and the use of these boys by adult males 121 Even serious minded pagan authors condemned this form of pederasty He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1 Consequently Paul Must have had could only have had pederasty in mind 122 We can not know what Paul would have said about the contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships 122 In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate intended meaning in Paul The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent He concludes that Paul does not care about any specific item in the lists 104 Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a catalogue of vices Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today 129 The model in today 's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT that Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today 's debate They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination 127 REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D. Wright In more recent years the positions of Bailey Boswell and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's view is that by David Wright In his thorough article Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswell 's treatment of arsenokoitai He faults Boswell for failing to cite or citing inaccurately all the references to Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers such as Eusebius the Apostolic Constitutions Clement of Alexandria Tertullian and Origen 127-28 Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages 129 This is significant for if the term is so derived it clearly refutes Boswell's claim that the first half of the word arseno- denotes not the object but the gender of the second half -koitai The LXX must mean a male who sleeps with a male making arseno- the object Wright also faults Boswell 's claims regarding linguistic features of the term including suggested parallels 129 Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms 131 Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force the first half denotes its object and where the second part is substantival the first half denotes its gender 132 It is with Boswell 's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue because the former has failed to cite all the sources For example Aristides Apology c. AD 138 probably uses arrenomaneis androbaten and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality 133 contrary to Boswell 's discussion Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus Refut Omn Haer 5:26:22-23 and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 133-34 Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks 134 Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia adultery porneia fornication and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris 136 Clement of Alexandria in Protr 10:108:5 cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as You shall not kill ou moicheuseis you shall not commit adultery ou paidophthoreseis you shall not practice homosexuality with boys you shall not steal 150 n. 43 Another occurrence of arsenokoitein commit homosexuality exists in the Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73 It may be Wright observes that the word was coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or.Sib. book 2 137-38 Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius 6th c. who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer in Macarius 4th-5th c. and in John the Faster d. 595 139-40 The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse contrary to Boswell Wright next replies to Boswell 's contention that the term would not be absent from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted 140-41 Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality that some sources e.g Didache show no acquaintance with Paul 's letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers 140-41 Boswell 's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright 's attention 141-44 Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom 1:26 Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom 's infrequent use of the term Wright observes that Boswell has signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity 144 It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world Wright also surveys the Latin Syriac and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning homosexual i.e. they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word 144-45 None of these primary versions supports Boswell 's limited conclusion based on them Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence The term came into being under the influence of the LXX 145 so that writers spoke generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides 146 If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable it is because the former encompassed the latter 146 In summary Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism The views of Boswell Scroggs and others who limit the term to active male prostitutes or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies

B2 Male sex survey Gay activity low A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough examination of American men 's sexual practices published since the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 2 percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3 Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population It 's a shame that we do n't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are

politics,talk.politics.misc,Well the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to social and political instability while economic inequality is much more strongly related In virtually all major revolutions including England the Puritan revolution France Russia and China the revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term growth and poverty was declining What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible If poverty were the main engine of social instability this typical historical pattern would not hold In fact revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time Much deleted Sorry buddy but some other blowhards managed to include the general welfare in another portion of the constitution Article I Section 8 The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL WELFARE of the United States I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they said in the preamble But as noted above the constitution does n't say that does it But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense in Article I Section 8 I guess you 'll grant that botha are constitutional functions Right jsh

science,sci.space,"I 've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest I 've transcribed some of my notes below Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine Permission is granted to copy this without restriction Michael Sternberg Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control Disarmament and International Security RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson went to Tonga to visit a friend While he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big TV fan Matt bought the King a satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty Since Tonga has a GNP of about 70 million His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this Matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots While this is n't entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 is a lot of slots The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting Tonga 's case Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots ranging from 70 E to 170 E slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside According to Sternberg four of these from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim RIMSAT was formed to use these slots It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately 2 billion It 's not easy to raise that kind of money Eventually they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I do n't think I 'll visit there for a long time Besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate For example everybody can sell you everything Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by Eventually RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of 150 million However Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures Since Glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms Eventually he worked out a deal and on Dec 4 1992 he met with Koptev who heads the Russian space program to sign the deal Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware NPO Applied Mechanics NPO PM to use their acronym This organization is located in Siberia ca n't figure out how to spell the town I need an atlas and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites They are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM His company is apparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partners.It apparently costs the Russians about 4 million to build a satellite that would sell for 50 million in the west If you want to give them specifications they 'll build you a satellite For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using costs run about 378,000 per transponder year This compares to 810,000 t/y in the U.S They can sell their time for about 1.1 million compared to 2.6 million in the U.S. RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons To get the best prices they bought in bulk They have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians which is being moved into place now Tidbits Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier Russian launches are self insured The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20 which is a huge retirement fund organization Cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we are n't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith Italy gets a new government every two weeks but we do n't worry because we 're used to it He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we wo n't worry about their stability as much Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting 25 in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in rubles To get around this RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry However Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime The older Gorizont Horizon satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites Sternberg downplayed the difference At these prices they can afford to launch new ones In addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware"

defenseman and Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but could n't put the puck over a sliding Ranford Later on Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom played very well too Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big Period ended scoreless but the edge to Sweden in creating more opportunities Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save Mark Recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros Eric one timed the puck but Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save At the 7-minute mark Canada started applying pressure on the Swedes Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked hard and kept the puck in the Swedes zone Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman came in on Soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom 's far post 1-0 Canada The Swedes picked up their game after that and Peter Forsberg had a shot that hit Ranford 's post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play Jan Larsson took a shot from the slot Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by the far post passed the puck and Ranford was beat 1-1 Third period started as the other periods Swedes having most of the pressure but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal At 5:54 Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it That resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman ca n't cover the puck in the goal crease Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he explained afterwards and he put it low on Soderstrom 's stick side close to the post Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside Gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1 The Swedes ran out of gas then and could n't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a rebound from Soderstrom where the Swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room A very good game the best in the WC so far with both goalies playing great Soderstrom best player in Sweden but Ranford even played better than Soderstrom that tells you something about Ranford Probably the best goalie in the world were some comments after the game Canada played a very disciplined defense Ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense Lindros played A LOT and played well Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden 's best along with Larsson-Juhlin- Nilsson Swedish defense played well 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros and managed this very well Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC and considering that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game he played very well Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game partly because of the Swedes inability to score and partly because of the linesman

Again goes to prove that it is better to be good than lucky You can count on good tomorrow Lucky seems to be prone to bad starts and a bad finish last year Yes I am enjoying every last run he gives up Who was it who said Morris was a better signing than Viola Hey Valentine I do n't see Boston with any world series rings on their fingers cheap shot Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his future who cares he had two of them before he came to Toronto and if the Jays had signed Viola instead of Morris it would have been Frank who won 20 and got the ring and he would be on his way to 20 this year too. Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best signing your logic is curious and spurious there is no reason to believe that Viola would n't have won as many games had he signed with Toronto when you compare their stupid W-L records be sure to compare their team 's offensive averages too now looking at anything like the Morris-Viola sweepstakes a year later is basically hindsight but there were plenty of reasons why it should have been apparent that Viola was the better pitcher based on previous recent years and also based on age Frank is almost 5 years younger how many knew that people got caught up in the '91 World Series and then on Morris 21 wins last year wins are the stupidest most misleading statistic in baseball far worse than RBI or R. that he won 21 just means that the Jays got him a lot of runs the only really valid retort to Valentine is were n't the Red Sox trying to get Morris too oh sure they said Viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say And do n't tell me Boston will win this year They wo n't even be in the top 4 in the division more like 6th if this is true it wo n't be for lack of contribution by Viola so who cares

religion,soc.religion.christian,I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System sort of a justice of the peace I had great difficulty with that duty I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage couples who obviously did n't realize that marriage is God 's institution not the state 's Gradually however I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular public capacity established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved I was really conducting a purely secular legal civil event with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial the couple who told me mid-ceremony to please hurry it up may have helped me to this conclusion I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God and marriage before the state until I had to deal with my own divorce Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue 's logical extension If intercourse or the mental intent of the parties or the ceremony of the church or any combination thereof establishes marriage then at what moment is it dissolved

Then for any fixed K the map sending X to E_K X is a permutation of the set of N-bit blocks Denote this permutation by P_K The set of all N-bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_ 2^N The collection of all these permutations P_K where K ranges over all possible keys is denoted E S_ 2^N If E were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E S_ 2^N to generate a large subset of S_ 2^N Coppersmith and Grossman COP74 have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group A_ 2^N given a sufficient number of rounds The alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all even permutations i.e. all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps Even and Goldreich EVE83 were able to extend these results to show that Feistel ciphers can generate A_ 2^N given a sufficient number of rounds The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group-theoretic properties of a cipher Multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys K1 K2 there does not exist a third key K3 such that E_K2 E_K1 X E_ K3 X which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys K1 K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3 If for every K1 K2 there exists a K3 such that eq is true then we say that E is a group This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was extensively studied by Sherman Kaliski and Rivest SHE88 In their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a group In fact DES is not a group CAM93 What can be proven about the security of a product cipher Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K appears to be a random element of S_ 2^N the symmetric group Let R be an element of S_ 2^N selected randomly We will say that P_K and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some order can not distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time That is with time bounded resources the observer can not determine which of the permutations is produced by E the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing Luby and Rackoff LUB88 have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size There are four standard modes of operation and numerous non-standard ones as well The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S. Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS 81 published in 1980 See the question about ECB below for more details Although they are defined for the DES block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block cipher Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation But one can not prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key can not be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 1985 for a standard method of message authentication using DES What exactly is DES DES is the U.S. Government 's Data Encryption Standard a product cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data using a 56-bit key It is defined in FIPS 46-1 1988 which supersedes FIPS 46 1977 FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm DEA defined in ANSI X3.92-1981 What is triple DES Triple DES is a product cipher which like DES operates on 64-bit data blocks There are several forms each of which uses the DES cipher 3 times Some forms use two 56-bit keys some use three The DES modes of operation may also be used with triple-DES Some people refer to E K1 D K2 E K1 x as triple-DES This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985 Financial Institution Key Management and is intended for use in encrypting DES keys and IVs for Automated Key Distribution Its formal name is Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key Pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE That standard says section 7.2.1 Key encrypting keys may be a single DEA key or a DEA key pair Key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed e.g. the data protected by the key s has a long security life A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key Others use the term triple-DES for E K1 D K2 E K3 x or E K1 E K2 E K3 x One of us Carl Ellison keeps advocating DES triple use in the form E K1 TRAN E K2 TRAN E K3 COMPRESS x where each DES instance has its own key and IV for CBC mode and TRAN has been posted on sci.crypt It is a large-block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part What is differential cryptanalysis Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on a repeated round function The method was recently popularized by Biham and Shamir BIH91 but Coppersmith has remarked that the S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago This method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably FEAL BI91a Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts Y Y whose corresponding plaintexts X X satisfy a known difference D X+X where is componentwise XOR In the basic Biham-Shamir attack 2^ 47 such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for DES Substantially fewer pairs are required if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds In these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling observations on the algorithm Most importantly if the key schedule was removed from DES and a 16 48 768-bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than 2^ 64 steps Thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES Further the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack Adi Shamir is quoted to say NYTimes Oct 13 1991 I would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened How was NSA involved in the design of DES According to Kinnucan KIN78 Tuchman a member of the group that developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers The NSA did not dictate a single wire Tuchman and Meyer another developer of DES spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in Lucifer They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer Their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions IBM has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains Tuchman On the other hand a document called Involvement of the NSA in the development of DES unclassified summary of the United States Select Committee on Intelligence printed in the IEEE Communications Magazine p53-55 1978 states In the development of DES NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures and certified that the final DES algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman presented above Is DES available in software Several people have made DES code available via ftp see part 10 for pathnames Stig Ostholm FTPSO BSD FTPBK Eric Young FTPEY Dennis Furguson FTPDF Mark Riordan FTPMR Phil Karn FTPPK A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson PAT87 FIPS 46-1 says The algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented using hardware not software technology Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in compliance with this standard Despite this software implementations abound and are used by government agencies Is DES available in hardware The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to

religion,talk.religion.misc,I had an ehum interesting experience with the Rosicrucians or at least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday They had advertised that they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King the room of the heart which rhymes in Swedish Out of curiosity I went to the lecture There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians one woman and two men apart from me The Rosicrucians were male both of them First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium Rosicrucianum which was founded in Harlem NL in 1925 He read straight from a piece of paper which I at that point was because he lacked experience in talking in front of people but the other guy read too and he was used to holding speeches I could tell The first guy also said that the R s are a mystical Christian order and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars English from the thirteenth century The other guy took over reading from his piece of paper in a fairy-tale teller 's voice What he said sounded like a load of crap to me Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something What made me a bit suspicious was the way they first said that we all contained something divine and could find our way back to divinity then that we could n't become divine as the persons we are currently but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss Maybe I've read too much RAW but it sounded very much like the things he talks about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your friends_ in _Prometheus rising_ It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians The one holding the actual lecture obviously was top dog and the other one seemed to be a true believer I got the impression that the top dog had more distance to the faith than the true believer that he used it to gain power and admiration He spoke like a fairy-tale teller whenever he remembered The information brochure is at home Should you want their address please e-mail me Ceci

politics,talk.politics.mideast,henrik Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan BM Gim me a break CAPITAL letters or NOT the above is pure nonsense It BM seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities henrik Again Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves What do henrik want them to do Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them News reports I 've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise CAPS do n't change facts BM while hoping that Turkey will stay out Stop and think for a moment BM will you Armenia does n't need anyone to drag her into the conflict it BM is a part of it henrik Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged henrik training AZERIS militarily to fight against KARABAKHI-Armenians So Should I at this point break into caps and start talking about DEFENSE etc. I do n't know how 'fully engaged Turkey is/was though henrik The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 henrik years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN are the henrik ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending henrik themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION BM Huh You did n't expect Azeri 's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM within their borders henrik Well history is SAD Remember those are relocated Azeris into henrik the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime So I hear This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact henrik At last I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the henrik KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER henrik OCCUR again BM You 're not playing with a full deck are you Where would Turkey invade henrik It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped henrik into Armenia if SHE could Why would Turkey do that Do you not realize that this is a local clash that Turkey never wished to see happen Turkey has other plans for region like economic revival co-operation etc Good stuff in other words I'd be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET rather than 'who killed whom in what way which I detest doing and would n't do BM Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g in the header BM in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun henrik Absolutely NOT I am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik cases HISTORY repeats itself Even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74 If there 'd been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their families I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel but I suspect what I 've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved BM Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes BM she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM the parties to the negotiating table That 's hard to do when Armenians BM are attacking Azeri towns henrik So let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying Turkey henrik wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT NOT So what do you think we want War death and destruction henrik I will believe it when I see it No if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it henrik Now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik to your HEAD Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef fat chance This kind of childish rhetoric does n't help anthing henrik Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU All the henrik BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN I mean henrik BURNING people ALIVE Now some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by Armenians One should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right BM Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the BM futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that BM leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that 's BM going to cause incessant skirmishes henrik Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic They are henrik NOT asking much They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY henrik from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN Well they obviously are n't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking not very peaceful I 'd say BM Think of 10 or 20 years down the line both of the newly independent BM countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM the other out These people will be neighbors would it not be better BM to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik Do n't get me WRONG I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik conflict But until Azeris realize that the Armenians in henrik KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion I do n't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans Peace is n't what 's happening right now furthermore what 's happening right now is n't condusive to peace You can spend days and nights raving about how 'right the Armenian position is and I 'm sure there 'll be others who 'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side If entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise Armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we 're right and we have the bombs so we 'll do whatever we want so there style of foreign relations Yes you can type Stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side You personally can choose not to do that of course this being just USENET The people in power should n't be so childish BM If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes BM your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM their blood and future henrik Again you are taking different TURNS Armenia HAS no intension henrik to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET Azeri 's would disagree with you on this and the maps I 've seen support what they 'd be saying It does n't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner BM It 's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled The Armenians BM in Armenia and N-K will be there with the same people you seem to hate BM as their neighbors for maybe 3000 years more The sooner there 's peace in BM the region the better it is for them and everyone else I 'd push for BM compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM inflammatory half-truths henrik It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative I am absolutely henrik for it It did n't look it when I read your posting It would seem to me that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness Fair henrik But in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be WIPED out Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik The Armenian Massacres You do n't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres Yes boys and girls let 's always talk about how bad and nasty things were Let 's do that so we 're overwhelmed by anger and let 's do that so our kids will also be hateful Sounds crazy does n't it Do n't

politics,talk.politics.mideast,I will again repeat my statement 1 I do not condone these indiscriminate Israeli acts nor have I ever 2 If the villagers do not know who these guerillas are which you stated earlier how do you expect the Israelis to know It is very difficult to identify who they are this is why the guerillas prefer to lose themselves in the general population by dressing the same acting the same etc. I agree but because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these attacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its situation Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control this third party state within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept occuring At what point does Israel or ANY state have the right to do something ITSELF to stop such attacks Never It is also the responsibility of any state to NOT ALLOW any outside party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state If 1 Angola had the power and 2 South Africa refused or could n't stop anti-Angolan guerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola and 3 South Africa refused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola would Angola be justified in entering SA If not are you saying that Angola HAD to accept the situation do NOTHING and absorb the attacks I refered above at all times to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from Lebanese soil NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel One hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its border but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger WHAT HAS CHANGED is that the PLO was largely driven out of Lebanon not by the Lebanese not by Syria and THAT is by far the most important making it EASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil That change was brought about by Israeli action the PLO would never have been ejected by Lebanese Arab state or UN actions I fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be used by EITHER side and have been and continue to be But the most fundamental issue is that if a state can not control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so it should expect others to do it for them Hopefully that other will be the UN but it is as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia weak

politics,talk.politics.mideast,"this is true this has merit but is not entirely true this last statement is not true According to the CBO the United States has a force of about 88,000 US Army personel in Europe I do not know if this includes a USMC division in Norway They have available a little more than 500 USAF attack aircraft including various models of the F-111 A-10 F-19A/B and a few F-4s there are about 1,000 more of these available SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME At one time the US maintained 1500 MBTs about half were M1A1 but some of these were relocated to the Persian Gulf I know the US has at LEAST one aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault brigade Does anyone know if there are any B-52/B-1Bs in England The point is although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped outside of St. Louis I also understand that the administration is planning to position troops in Macedonia Any reaction out there to this Question day before yesterday I heard that Serbia Montenegro had imposed additional trade sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Rebels This morning a NPR reported at a bridge on the Drina sp verified that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to Bosnia A Serbian who happened to be muslim stated that just a few months ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station Now everyone is stopped and searched many are turned back Of course all I heard was a translators version I do not speak Serbo-Croatian If this is a effort on the part of Serbia Montenegro for whatever reason to push the Boserbs into accepting the V-O is this not a good thing"
politics,talk.politics.guns,Hi In Canada any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed I think it 's a small metal tag that 's placed over the trigger The net result of this is that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears or psychos in the National Parks Instead one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances of hiking in bear country and take the appropriate precautions I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer to Nature that they are a part of Nature and as such have to deal with nature on it 's own terms

science,sci.med,I do not know a lot about this except from seeing one patient with Kartagener 's syndrome which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus bronchiectasis and chronic infections Situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong side of the body and can be complete or partial It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion so that in absence of this laterality can be random People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools because of their rarity and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they ca n't find the patient 's heart sounds because they 're on the wrong side According to Harrison 's immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected But there may be much more current information on this and as usual in medicine we may be talking about more than one conditiion I would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist of which there is probably one at NCSU

religion,talk.religion.misc,Very well put And in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian brother yet continues in his sin and claims that his sin is not a sin at all but perfectly acceptable what should be done Should Christians just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person By reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible are they using a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus Frankly I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to pass himself off as a 'straight Christian in order to have other Christians accept his chastisement better a lot more serious than people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin

science,sci.med,I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on This type of loss is difficult to fit I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I could n't compare them 'head to head with the Widex Nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids I could take a trip to Europe on the difference Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that are n't quite so expensive

computer,comp.graphics,The OTIS Project '93 The Operative Term Is STIMULATE -this file last updated 4-21-93 WHAT IS OTIS OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny and distribution Digital immortality The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future Perhaps they 'll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes but they 'll be there and someone will dig them up If that does n't interest you OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors Suddenly life is breathed into your work and by merit of it 's stimulus it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons Spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you 've got the gumption that 's what they 're here for WHERE OTIS currently as of 4/21/93 has two FTP sites 141.214.4.135 projects/otis the UWI site sunsite.unc.edu /pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS the SUNsite you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well Merely anonymous FTP to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory Do n't forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you 're in binary OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff Underground Cafe Omaha 402.339.0179 2 lines CyberDen SanFran 415.472.5527 Usenet Waffle-iron HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE What happens is you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo get it scanned into an image file then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me email addresses at eof in email After the image is received it will be put into the correct directory Computer originated works are also welcome OTIS directories house two types of image files GIF and JPG GIF and JPG files require oddly enough a GIF or JPG viewer to see These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find If you ca n't find one but do have a GIF viewer you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change JPG files to a standard GIF format OTIS also accepts animation files When you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view Also include some biographical information on yourself we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works You can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself instead of emailing If you have pictures but no scanner there is hope Merely send copies to The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha NE 68124-1113 I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back Also include information on each image preferably a 1-3 line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it 's finally put If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well Conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and we 'll arrange things If you want to submit your works by disk peachy Merely send a 3.5 disk to the above address Omaha and a SASE if you want your disk back This is good for people who do n't have direct access to encoders or FTP but do have access to a scanner We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format If possible please submit image files as GIF or JPG If you ca n't we can convert from most formats we 'd just rather not have to At senders request we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand Even if you do n't have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an SASE or 2.50 for disk postage and packing to get a slab-o-OTIS As of 04/21/93 we 're at about 18 megabytes of files and growing Email me for current archive size and directory DISTRIBUTION The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another In fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such If you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images It would also be nice if you 'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is It 's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible If you have the time please upload a few to your favorite BBS system or even just post this info-file there It would be keen of you USE If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory you 'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit You will either find this in the .rm file for the image or series of images or in the Artists directory under the Artists name If permission is n't explicitly given then you 'll have to contact the artist to ask for it If no info is available email me ed cwis.unomaha.edu and I 'll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information When you DO use permitted work it 's always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files NAMING IMAGES Please keep the names of your files in dos format That means keep the filename before .jpg or .gif to eight characters or less The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number Thus Leonardo DeVinci 's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek5.gif OR ldmek5.jpg OR ldmech5.gif ETC Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems CREATING IMAGE FILES When creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture This gives people a reference in case they 'd like to contact you You may also want to include a title address or other information you 'd like people to know HMMM That 's about it for now More guidelines will be added as needed Your input is expected DISCLAIMER The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS a sumerian deity or it 's followers be they pope priest or ezine administrator We do take sacrifices and donations however DISCLAIMER The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original image files The files will go to the public at large It 's possible as with any form of mass-media that someone could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain Unless you 've given permission for that it 's illegal OTIS takes no responsibility for this In simple terms all rights revert to the author/artist To leave an image on OTIS is to give permission for it to be viewed copied and distributed electronically If you do n't want your images distributed all-over do n't upload them To leave an image on OTIS is NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or broadcast that incurs profit this includes but is not limited to magazines newsletters clip-art software screen-printed clothing etc You must give specific permission for this sort of usage Remember the operative term is stimulate If you know of people that 'd be interested in this sort of thing get them involved kick'm in the booty offer them free food whatever e ed cwis.unomaha.edu ed sunsite.unc.edu

religion,soc.religion.christian,I agree with Carol here Determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of time And we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative For example I recently was asking some children the question What temperature does water boil at I got the answer 212 degrees consistently I asked if they knew what scale and was told It 's just 212 degrees Any scale That 's what all thermometers say Well that 's sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong IT is NOT an absolute truth Similarly Scripture is full of Truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism IMO example of head-covering in Church deleted This was a good example There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth which was having a LOT of trouble with order Is it Absolute Truth to me No And I see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally I 've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way I agree Very few And even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me I ca n't prove the existence of absolutes I can only rely upon MY experience I also trust God 's revelation that WE can not fully comprehend the infinite Therefore we ca n't comprehend the Absolutes So I do n't need them I can never know the essence of God only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God 's creation So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes but it is of no practical importance It 's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be Swell Who cares It does n't affect me in any practical useful way I might as well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on Mars Maybe God did So what Is that going to have ANY effect on how I deal with my neighbor or God Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch No This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning Christianity is true wonderful and sensible It appeals to Reason since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world NOTE I 'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority That 'd be silly There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive Good parents like God are authoritative Many Christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adults respond to this treatment Larry Overacker llo shell.com

politics,talk.politics.mideast,"I know it does n't make sense but since when is 'Napoleon about sense anyway Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain Greeks still exists in our day Most Greeks insist even today that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul but by its half a millennium-old moniker 'Cons whatever Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today The name of Stalingrad too is long gone replaced by Volgagrad China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world But Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul by the name of 'Cons How can one explain this total intransigence What makes Greeks so different from other mortals 18-year-old questionable democracy Why do n't they seem to reconcile with the fact for instance that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD and that this predates the discovery of the New World by 39 years The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later Should n't then half a millennium be considered enough time for 'Cons to be called a Turkish city Where is the logic in the Greek reasoning if there is any How long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization Ancient Greece does not exist any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil of Anatolia These undereducated 'wieneramus live with an illusion It is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island No history book shows that it ever was It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock stock and barrel for a period of well over 300 years In fact prior to the Turks acquisition of it following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD the island of Cyprus belonged invariably to several nations The Assyrians the Sumerians the Phoenicians the Egyptians the Ottoman Turks of course in that order owned it as their territory But it has never been the possession of the government of Greece not even for one day in the history of the world Moreover Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland but only 40 miles from Turkiye 's southern coastline Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony Those 'Arromdians involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality Again wishful thinking is unproductive only facts count As for Selanik Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled particularly to Salonica whose Jewish population increased substantially as a result from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908 more than half the total population though even there increased persecution by local Greeks led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire particularly to the great port of Izmir Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike the ritual murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on Greek efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913 following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War when many of its Jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday stimulating a new Jewish exodus as it was intended to do Between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica with the Cambel quarter where most of the remaining Jews lived being burned to the ground This was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools A start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out 47 By killing and driving out large numbers of Jews the Greeks left a substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time and starting Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the occupation of Greece starting in 1941 Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence Istanbul Edirne and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received thousands more Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the Sultan Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained independence or expanded The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the Crimean War combined with the same independence movements in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its Jews caused thousands of helpless ill and poverty-stricken Muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the Ottoman Empire with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could From 1850 to 1864 as many as 800,000 Crimean Tatars Circassians and other Muslims from north and east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone as many as 200,000 more came during the next twenty years while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the Empire. 47 Robert Mantran 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de Salonqiue a

Shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS Anthony S. Fauci M.D. director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick If these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in the United States have HIV By the end of the decade the World Health Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old NIAID which funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine ACTG sites around the country and three sites participating in the ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 47 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 stimulate new ones It will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease The results from the pediatric trial known as ACTG 218 will be examined closely for other reasons as well This trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines said Daniel Hoth M.D. director of NIAID 's division of AIDS We need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent HIV infection in children In the United States most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city areas and more than 80 percent are minorities mainly black or Hispanic Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen They can not have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study Study chair John S. Lambert M.D. of the University of Rochester Medical School and co- chair Samuel Katz M.D. of Duke University School of Medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara M.D. medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID 's division of AIDS We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said Dr. McNamara We 'll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects He emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 48 Volume 6 Number 10 April 20 1993 products The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant HIV proteins These so-called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden Conn. contains gp160 a protein that gives rise to HIV 's surface proteins plus alum adjuvant Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine Presently alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration Both of the other vaccines one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco and the other by Biocine a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy in Emeryville Calif. contain the major HIV surface protein gp120 plus adjuvant The Genentech vaccine contains alum while the Biocine vaccine contains MF59 an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other Phase I vaccine trials in adults A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine and three children will be given adjuvant alone considered the placebo Neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive If the low dose is well-tolerated controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will begin Each child will receive six immunizations one every four weeks for six months and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization For more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment call the AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service 1-800-TRIALS-A from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST weekdays The service has Spanish-speaking information specialists available Information on NIAID 's pediatric HIV/AIDS research is available from the Office of Communications at 301 496- 5717 NIH CDC and FDA are agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service in HHS For press inquiries only please call Laurie K.

McEntee explains OSHA does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the job yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA coverage for public employees said McEntee This despite the fact that public employees highway workers health care workers corrections officers to name but a few do some of the most dangerous work in our society This year we are fighting for passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces We need the public support to be successful Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers and these injuries are almost 75 percent more severe Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed in 1970 and today public employees in more than half the states have no OSHA coverage -30-"

computer,comp.graphics,I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that will do compositing of a series of pictures What I mean by compositing is say I have a live video clip digitized panning around a living room and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen I want to combine these two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black I want the living room picture to show through Yes I realize I can do this with a genlock and I do own a genlock but I want to be able to do manual compositing also It 's ok if I have to composite one frame at a time I assumed I 'd have to do that anyway But being able to composite a series of frames would be even better I 've looked around and I have n't found a PC package that will perform this Help please If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation into AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format AutoDesk Animator will do this for you It can take one animation make a certain color clear and overlay it over another animation I do not have a way right now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files Animator will also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation so if your video capture stuff can create this is might work

Either some of you are a little paranoid no offence OR you should get a new goverment You do have elections Guns 'n Criminals MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen Known criminals can NOT buy weapons that 's one of the points of gun control And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one What I meant was that cars CAN kill but they are not GUNS Someone said that if we 'ban guns we 'd have to ban cars to because they 'kill to I do n't think we should argue on this one The issue I hope I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem Guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for I think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex Jugoslavia They should all have weapons it 's their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other Innocent people the problem is humans not guns If 50 of ALL murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it 's the 'axer An example do n't flame me just because not exactly 50 are killed by guns Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves Is this a good situation Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen I mean if everybody had a gun in USA Do n't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland they have gun control that works in England and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents Something about throwing stones in glass houses Do n't flame them because of what to three children did either Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace YES My numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot-guns are from the police and the Statistisk Sentralbyraa understood that one Sorenson LAST WORD Responsible gun owners are not a problem but they will be affected if you want to protect your citicens This is not a .signature It 's merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith and to bring down the evil Internet

available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717 THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April 16 1993 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has been developed by government engineers The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology It can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals A key-escrow system will be established to ensure that the Clipper Chip is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device When the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key-escrow data bases that will be established by the Attorney General Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap The Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices In addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists We need the Clipper Chip and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key-escrow system the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace and the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information This infrastructure of high-speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images HDTV programming and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet The provisions of the President 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available For additional details call Mat Heyman National Institute of Standards and Technology 301 975-2758 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations A No Clipper Chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans Q Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device What would they have to do to decipher the message A They would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers The key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system Q Who will run the key-escrow data banks A The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities At this point the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks Q How strong is the security in the device How can I be sure how strong the security is A This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities Q Whose decision was it to propose this product A The National Security Council the Justice Department the Commerce Department and other key agencies were involved in this decision This approach has been endorsed by the President the Vice President and appropriate Cabinet officials Q Who was consulted The Congress Industry A We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative Q Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers A The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them Q Who provides the Clipper Chip A Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance California and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future Q How do I buy one of these encryption devices A We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the Clipper Chip into their devices Q If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices A This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the Administration is developing The Administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the U.S. saying that every American as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product There is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either-or proposition Rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper Chip and similar encryption techniques Q What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration A It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism Q Will the devices be exportable Will other devices that use the government hardware A Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices The same is true for other encryption devices One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad With this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

religion,soc.religion.christian,However greatly we extoll Mary it is quite obvious that she is in no way God or even part of God or equal to God The Assumption of our Blessed Mother meant that because of her close identification with the redemptive work of Christ she was Assumed note that she did not ASCEND body and soul into Heaven and is thus one of the few along with Elijah Enoch Moses maybe who are already perfected in Heaven Obviously the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to any of the previously mentioned personages As I said it is a provocative thought From Answer to Job The logical consistency of the papal declaration can not be surpassed and it leaves Protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a _man 's religion_ which allows no metaphysical representation of woman Protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the signs of the times which point to the equality of women But this equality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a divine woman the bride of Christ Just as the person of Christ can not be replaced by an organization so the bride can not be re- placed by the Church The feminine like the masculine demands an equally personal representation The dogmatizing of the Assumption does not however according to the dogmatic view mean that Mary has attained the status of a goddess although as mistress of heaven and mediatrix she is functionally on a par with Christ the king and mediator At any rate her position satisfies the need of the archetype par 753-4 Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology Jung made it clear that he was talking about psychology not theology His comments had to do with the psychological _image_ of God and its function in the human psyche not about the actual existence or nature of God

science,sci.crypt,While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order there is still a good point here Local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies Based on the possibly incomplete understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning only the FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer which seems to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request This moves a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade people who do n't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd A national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political viewpoints
recreation,rec.sport.baseball,You 're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched in between Clark and Bonds He must and I mean MUST get fastballs to hit otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds Williams and Clark 3-4-5 the reason being that I feel Bonds potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he 's stuck behind two slow runners I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the 3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having Clark in the 5 spot
science,sci.electronics,Hi all I 'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up Our current automation consoles date from the early 60 's and do n't provide this function We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit 120 VAC is momentarily closed for at least 0.5 second I 've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay activated when the cue tape completes the circuit Low tech and simple but there 's one problem In order to get the 1/2 second pulse there needs to be a sh load of cuetape on the film 35mm runs at 90 feet per minute so to get a 1/2 second pulse there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape Ideally I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort I 'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated Thanks Mark Fontana

politics,talk.politics.misc,Peter Nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in talk.politics.misc so I need not consume more bandwidth here What I meant if it was not clear was the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophies of natural rights and how the government and Constitutional interpretation in particular fits into that philosophy This philosophy engages in the very serious practical error of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost totalitarian authority completely outside of the consent or consensus of The People This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing political fist-fights these days because He who Controls the Court Rules the Country The people on the Court may well be trying to do the best job they can but they are at best a benevolent oligarch even if you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever Eventually an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear Try Supreme Court cases by Jury and the problem would be mitigated a great deal Those who would create broad non-enumerated government powers at any level as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-facto standard in the U.S. have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian virtually unchecked except by plurality election death or retirement government power This is like asking why the wind blows unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities Very few human activities indeed fit into this category Even for those few that do who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity Who defines picking my pocket and defrauding Are economic assets a person 's only assets or are peace of mind stability confidence in a child 's emotional environment security and many other things not also a part of a person's assets What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to What gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability If you say that what you do does not have those effects by what authority do you say that Who is empowered to make these value judgements If the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so the federal government would prevent you from doing so If it did not and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local Constitution by say a 3/4 majority empowering the local government to do so then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values This is not an ideal situation but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now When you define rights very broadly there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these rights overlap Even when rights are defined very narrowly the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights The fundamental question is by whose authority is that power created If you support the current situation with a natural rights Supreme Court rather than an original understanding Supreme Court or even better Supreme Court by Jury you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington D.C. create those powers out of the air In my Fractal Federalism scenario it is a broad consensus of The People i.e the amendment process that creates those powers No I mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to tell the locals how to run their neighborhood Waco TX is a nice example If you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the cause of personal autonomy have you done anything different What precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to If you list them perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them The Koresh Incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means I would abolish The constitutionality of no-knock warrants seems very dubious to me not to mention the mere existence of BATF and the government 's propensity to ignore the word infringe in the Second Amendment This power is upheld by the same body with its incredible concentration of power in the hands of nine people that has upheld much so-called Civil Rights read- affirmative action legislation despite the Fourteenth Amendment Money is certainly not the only asset I have in this world If it were this would be a bleak existence

religion,soc.religion.christian,I think you are vastly oversimplifying things We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ For example ACT 5:40 His speech persuaded them They called the apostles in and had them flogged Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go ACT 5:41 The apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus 's name ACT 5:28 We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name he said Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man 's blood Finally the first apostle 's death James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome 's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth That would have been extremely difficult for some people especially those that had plotted to kill Him

science,sci.crypt,You are correct several times TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard shared between the NATO governments to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction The limits set in the standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be exploited It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons Among other things I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT To that can be added the video driver card the RS232 parallel cable and the printer head The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the crudest of equipment Were I to apply good test equipment and some intelligence to measuring emission levels I would find many other potential sources of leaked information Where cryptography is used for serious purposes poor TEMPEST protection becomes an important security hazard In the early eighties the need to allow some commercial concerns particularly financial institutions a level of protection against TEMPEST threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 'release of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use I say 'release for while equipment to meet the standard is available at a price and to approved customers AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified If you think about it it would really have to would n't it

religion,alt.atheism,Well I 've said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder However who is at blame is another question It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame Yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity Presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this And I argue that our law system is a similar risk Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this In fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents But such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road Again the blame is on society Yes but the state is not at fault in such a case The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses Okay so this is what you call murder But the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances But this is basically how it works Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution And every member of society shares this blame And most people 's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it Murder violates the golden rule Executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not But in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth That is twelve members must be convinced of a truth But then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair Yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we ca n't always determine the difference in our flawed system I think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still is n't objectively perfect You see it does n't matter if we know it is fair or not Objectively it is either fair or it is not But what we know has no effect on an objective system Why are you so sure Why is your reality important But we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely And you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system Well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible Yes we all bear the responsibility Most people seem willing to do this We must realize the consequences of all our actions Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack I do n't think our country has an objective system but I think such an objective system can exist in theory Without omniscience an objective system is not possible in practice

religion,soc.religion.christian,There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which are problematic It 's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me I understand that when you pray in tongues the spirit is doing the talking And when you pray you pray to God And the Spirit is God So the Spirit is talking to Himself Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it 's an actual language Moreover the phrase though I speak with the tongues of men and angels used by Paul in I Cor is misleading out of context Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue and if when they speak it is no KNOWN language then it is an angelic tongue Hmmm in the old testament story about the tower of Babel we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all that they have the SAME one amongst other angels After all THEY were not punished in any manner So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER It 's disturbing to think that some people find ways to justify jabbering But I 'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned Trouble is while such stories abound any and all attempts at verification and we are to test the spirit either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances or that outright fabrication was involved The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a friend of a friend thing And linguistically a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language inflection or no

computer,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,Has anyone observed this If I copy a large say 800K+ file a large PKZIP file for instance to my floppy drive 3.5 under MS Windows 3.1 via either Program Manager or a DOS Shell the file copied under the DOS shell has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not The corruption is detected by executing pkunzip -t b \file.zip after both copies The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption Now here 's the kicker I have many windows open while doing this both DOS and WINDOWs apps Supposedly all WINDOWs apps share the same time slice whereas the DOS apps get their own equal time slice unless overriden So as an example I have 5 WINDOWs apps open 2 multitasking DOS sessions running and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized inactive Under this scenario CPU time is divided into two major slices one for all the Windows apps and one slice for the running DOS app When copying under Windows PGM MGR I 'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks are essentially inactive Thus PGM MGR gets say 80 of the Windows slice and 95 of the execution-background DOS shell 's slices Thus it gets .8 .95 ^2 .72 or 72 of the total available CPU time When copying in a DOS shell I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell no other DOS background tasks allowed full screen under the Windows task manager The CPU time available to this shell would be 80 of the Windows slice assumming inactive Windows applications and 100 of the DOS slice 1.0 .8 .8 or 80 of the total available CPU time So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU time Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy copy It must be Miscellaneous data Running Windows on top of DOS 5.0 qemm 5.x rapidbios.sys 2.0 mbyte smartdrive no delayed writes two ramdrives logitech mouse driver 6.2 full 16mbytes motherboard RAM 64Kbyte motherboard cache 386 DX 33 Mhz Running dos-edit.com TSR in the DOS shell
computer,comp.graphics,I suppose you do n't know what about we have discussed We discussed about error s in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV that is there must be a colormap anyway The problems you present are exist anyway and I did n't tried to solve them at all because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented There 's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image Ok you 're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit My solution does n't work because there 's no colormap withing real 24bit image you see user see 24bit image going back to 8bit is silly About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image XV allows this feature but I do n't recommend to use it with the mentioned type images Moreover XV is not a paint program you can only make those global changes In full 24bit XV changing individual colors sounds like paint program job If person have 8bit screen there 's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified Because user do n't see full 24bit image there 's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized To select indiavidual color there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from that Ok I do n't have thought very much 24bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that Also human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same So XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design error I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design So even all screen images are 8bit the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily instead of 8bit Before anybody will make a note yes I may as well make a lift where 'up means that the lift goes down and 'down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it does n't solve the problem Americans the lift is just an example Well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read it

mysite to specify your correct e-mail address to reply to 1 What is JPEG JPEG pronounced jay-peg is a standardized image compression mechanism JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural real-world scenes It does not work so well on non-realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings JPEG does not handle black-and-white 1-bit-per-pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other named JBIG and MPEG respectively JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans If you plan to machine-analyze your images the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality You can make extremely small files if you do n't mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc Conversely if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression 2 Why use JPEG There are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the size ratio is more like four to one More details below If your viewing software does n't support JPEG directly you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images Even with a JPEG-capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format GIF for instance Thus using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply It 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information 24 bits/pixel 16 million colors instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer colors If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you Within a couple of years though 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today Furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard 3 When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF JPEG is not going to displace GIF entirely for some types of images GIF is superior in image quality file size or both One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material JPEG is superior even if you do n't have 24-bit display hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do See section 7 for details GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings In particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF JPEG ca n't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects This sort of image is best kept in GIF form In particular single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they should be avoided in JPEG files JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels for example Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting Again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in GIF files borders overlaid text etc The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixels high If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text do n't JPEG it Computer-drawn images ray-traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity The more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it The same goes for semi-realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such Plain black-and-white two level images should never be converted to JPEG You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels while JPEG is not If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG You will lose a little image quality if you do Section 7 which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only applies if both formats start from a full-color original If you start from a GIF you 've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information JPEG can only make things worse However the disk space savings may justify converting anyway This is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hints Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not convert well 4 How well does JPEG compress images Pretty darn well Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor The first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format no compression 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress does n't accomplish a lot you 'll note Other text-oriented compressors give similar results ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info GIF saves 8 bits/pixel not 24 See sec 7 ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 highest useful quality setting This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 default setting You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on-screen at once ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it 's been JPEGed without seeing the original Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG 's characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg -blocksmooth helps some Still I 've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize -optimize cuts table overhead Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes Note that this file is TINY the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 In this case JPEG can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF better if you have a full-color display This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes 5 What are good quality settings for JPEG Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95 of the information as some have claimed The quality scale is purely arbitrary it 's not a percentage of anything The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb The default quality setting -Q 75 is very often the best choice This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image Try -Q 75 first if you see defects then go up Except for experimental purposes never go above -Q 95 saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any better quality If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation On the other hand you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs see section 14 for more info If you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art Note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B and to many programs based on it Other JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale Some programs do n't even provide a numeric scale just high medium low -style choices 6 Where can I get JPEG software Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP If you do n't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources If you do n't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the same article That article appears regularly in news.answers or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body The Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful it 's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive NOTE this list changes constantly If you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive 6A If you are looking for canned software viewers etc The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system If you do n't see what you want for your machine check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet but some commercial programs are listed too X Windows XV shareware 25 is an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other image formats It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu 18.24.0.12 file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 2.21 also available from export Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display you 'll get only 8-bit color nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG CAUTION there is a glitch in version 2.21 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file or the file will be blurry Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software Both of the above are large complex packages If you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1 The next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays MS-DOS This covers plain DOS for Windows or OS/2 programs see the next headings One good choice is Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files The current version 2.5 is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca 129.97.50.50 file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines The user interface is not flashy but it 's functional Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview The current version 1.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager QEMM386 and 386MAX work Windows and OS/2 do not Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen For larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do You may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably Note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS 30 This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking although personally I find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware For images larger than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than Hiview The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip Requires a VESA graphics driver if you do n't have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver so do n't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but I do n't know any stable archive location for it The current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW supports JPEG in its latest revision 8.60a However CSHOW 's JPEG implementation is n't very good it 's slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays Too bad it 'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW Shareware 25 Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine If you ca n't get any of them to work you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer If you have hi-color hardware do n't use GIF as the intermediate format try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays The Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats Handmade Software offers free JPEG GIF conversion tools GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format in particular you ca n't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability Version 2.0 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip NOTE do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is not readable on non-PC platforms Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package Image Alchemy This will translate JPEG files both JFIF and HSI formats to and from many other image formats It can also display images A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20 The Internet 's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20 full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil 192.88.110.20 Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos/graphics at Simtel20 that really means pd1 msdos.graphics If you are not physically on MILnet you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20 There are several Internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the Simtel20 archives most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117 which keeps Simtel20 files in eg /pub/msdos/graphics If you have no FTP capability you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how If you are outside the USA consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is Microsoft Windows There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware due to Windows system overhead Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers But it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway at least for previewing JView is freeware fairly fast has good on-line help and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format but it ca n't create new JPEG files and it does n't view GIFs JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it's an excellent basic viewer The current version 0.9 is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.84 file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites including wuarchive.wustl.edu WinJPEG shareware 20 displays JPEG GIF Targa TIFF and BMP image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE above file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip This is a slow 286-compatible version if you register you 'll get the 386-only version which is roughly 25 faster ColorView is another shareware entry 30 This was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG If you want to try it anyway the current version is 0.97 available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS DVPEG see DOS heading also works under Windows but only in full-screen mode not in a window OS/2 The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu 128.123.35.151 Note check /pub/uploads for more recent versions the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs version 4 /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same for OS/2 1.x /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02 image conversion/viewing

description in Windows section Shareware 20 /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip PMView 0.85 JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer GIF viewing very fast JPEG viewing fast if you have huge amounts of RAM otherwise about the same speed as the above programs Strong 24-bit display support Shareware 20 Macintosh Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple 's JPEG implementation which is part of the QuickTime system extension so you need to have QuickTime installed To use QuickTime you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later If you 're running System 6 you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension this is built-in on System 7 You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx As of 11/92 this file contains QuickTime 1.5 which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file However some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5 Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format PICT/JPEG is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format See section 10 for details If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format PICT/JPEG format or GIF format It also can convert between the two JPEG formats The current version 2.0 is a big improvement over prior versions Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx Requires System 7 and QuickTime On 8-bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers in fact it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers You can zoom in on any desired portion though Some people like this behavior some do n't Overall JPEGView 's user interface is very well thought out GIFConverter a shareware 40 image viewer/converter supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats The latest version is 2.3.2 Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx Requires System 6.0.5 or later GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images Also the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images without QuickTime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime But it 's faster with QuickTime Note If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEG GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code If you are using this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert Apple 's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these formats You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx Requires QuickTime PictPixie was intended as a developer 's tool and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface Worse PictPixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix There is an old version of PictPixie called PICTCompressor floating around the net If you have this you should trash it as it 's even buggier Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net Storm Technology 's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on older systems It does need 32-bit QuickDraw so really old machines can't use it You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG to allow Picture Decompress to open it If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw a Mac Plus for instance GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing If you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG to allow Photoshop to recognize it Amiga Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch 130.60.80.80 There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one In the USA a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter as well as being a general image manipulation tool It 's cheap shareware 20 and can read several formats besides JPEG The current version is 2.0.8 A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch and mirror sites file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 but it is otherwise fully functional Rend24 shareware 30 is an image

real money there are several commercial packages that support JPEG Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend24 and Viewtek These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and ImageFX an impressive 24-bit image capture conversion editing painting effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph Both are distributed by Great Valley Products Art Department Professional ADPro from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with

magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month without so much as notifying the authors Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of In my opinion anything older than IJG version 3 March 1992 is not worth the disk space it 's stored on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer Atari ST The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM GIF Targa formats For monochrome ST monitors try MGIF which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering Version 4.1 reads JPEG files Available from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris but surely there must be some by now Pointers appreciated Acorn Archimedes ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking Recent versions since 7.11 of the shareware program Translator can handle

Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization if you 'd like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join 7 What 's all this hoopla about color quantization Most people do n't have full-color 24 bit per pixel display hardware Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time To display a full-color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors This process is called color quantization This is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term We 're stuck with the standard usage though Clearly color quantization is a lossy process It turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings Since JPEG is a full-color format converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization This is true for all color JPEGs even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG what comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors but thousands of colors This happens because JPEG 's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image source The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output Incidentally because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG This tells me that the poster a has n't read this FAQ and b probably converted the JPEG from a GIF JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale just like photographs but number of colors just is n't a useful concept for JPEG On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors A GIF does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entries For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients do n't have to This is also the disadvantage of GIF you 're stuck with the sender's quantization If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re-quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image Furthermore if the sender did n't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm you 're out of luck For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware JPEG 's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user 's display hardware Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG images you already have With a GIF you 're stuck forevermore with what was sent It 's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the GIF one to display it but often it's also due to sloppiness JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones Finally an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already 15-bit hi-color PC displays true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes etc For these people GIF is already obsolete as it can not represent an image to the full capabilities of their display JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively Thus JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion 8 How does JPEG work The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding This article 's long enough already so I 'm not going to say more than that here For technical information see the comp.compression FAQ This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part 1-3 If you need help in using the news.answers archive see the top of this article 9 What about lossless JPEG There 's a great deal of confusion on this subject The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input However this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offers much less compression At present very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step With the V4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations can not cope with the resulting file Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image At this minimum-loss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel furthermore JPEG is public domain at least with a Huffman back end while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents 10 Why all the argument about file formats Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations Since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem In the absence of official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs are n't compatible with anybody else 's The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that 's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems They have defined two JPEG-based file formats JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a low-end format that transports pixels and not much else TIFF/JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format TIFF is a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF It 's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products it 's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are available to do it see Mac portion of section 6A If you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand see section 11 for details Another particular case is Handmade Software 's programs GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format By default though they write a proprietary format developed by HSI This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings Use the -j switch to get JFIF output This applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit JFIF format by default You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms 11 How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wo n't read it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file 1 A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters hex FF D8 FF E0 followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 10 followed by 'JFIF 2 If you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw JPEG file This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software it 's worth a try anyway 3 HSI files start with 'hsi1 You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they wo n't decompress properly with non-HSI programs 4 A Macintosh PICT file if JPEG-compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header scan for 'JFIF Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it 5 Anything else it 's a proprietary format or not JPEG at all If you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream look for FF D8 try stripping off everything before that In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is begin line M_ C_X whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with begin line M If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files 12 What about arithmetic coding The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file On typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM AT T and Mitsubishi Thus you can not legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles In particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future Stay tuned for further details 13 Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE In general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i.e. you get an identical JPEG file Even this is not true at least not with the current free JPEG software It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation If you 're wondering why it 's because the pixel-block boundaries move If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but that 's a mighty limited capability The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps Use a lossless format PPM RLE TIFF etc while working on the image then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way 14 What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG As stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from it 's far better to make a JPEG from that But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in section 3 in particular cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors do n't convert well You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be larger than the GIF So check the sizes too Experience to date suggests that large high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation Do n't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes Also don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be i.e. shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image While useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing If you are on an X Windows system XV 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input but for GIF inputs Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher Q setting may not be necessary Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value The trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image if you had it To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you 'd get without smoothing With the V4 free JPEG software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you do n't want If you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package However cjpeg 's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs But if you really care about the image you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info uunet.uu.net

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,And some comments with some players deleted Yep that Kevin Mitchell I never would have expected him in the 1 spot It 's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only As with first and second base 1988 was the year of the glove Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year Looks good Too bad he 's moving to short Highest five-year regular though he 's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell The other elite fielders in the league This is an interesting line His 1988 figure was slightly below average His 1990 was pathetic and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody Part of that may be his mobility 1988 was with the Yankees 1990 was with the Padres who appear to have a rotten infield 1991 was with the Twins and judging by Leius and Gaetti the Metrodome may be a good place to play third Add another to the elite fielders list Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value I do n't know what happened to Caminiti judging by the three previous years his low 1992 may be a fluke Sabo is merely average however His incredible 1988 best year ever brings his average up a lot Strange last two years According to reputation one of the best fielders ever at third base But at the end he was below average Average in 1988 was .643 Boggs has been pretty good I do n't know what happened in 1990 but every other year he has been above average usually by quite a bit Last year a fluke or a portent Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another but very different from year to year Any ideas Brook is declining Three first-time regulars above average in 1992 I 'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding He 's never had a good year but while at second he improved to become an average fielder and is an average fielder at third Zeile on the other hand is a below average fielder Each year he 's about 10 points below average And it 's probably not just the park since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this Moving back to second was a good idea So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively He 's had a grand total of one year above the league DA and was pretty bad last year Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford separated at birth To his credit HoJo did have one above average year 1990 Lansford could n't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove Good hitter but his fielding needs work Not a good fielder Both are better off at shortstop Two consecutive horrible years for Leo Camden Yards does n't seem to have helped his fielding any Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA but the lowest DA at third ever Congratulations Dean Dale J.

science,sci.space,SSF is up for redesign again Let 's do it right this time Let 's step back and consider the functionality we want 1 microgravity/vacuum process research 2 life sciences research adaptation to space 3 spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach explified by Shuttle and SSF so far was to centralize functionality These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication Over 50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization Meanwhile military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation Firstly different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits etc Secondly the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed SSF 's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization 1 We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now COMET and Mir for long-duration flights Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights The best strategy for this area is inexpensive incremental improvement installation of U.S. facilities on Mir Shuttle/Mir linkup and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO 2 We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity but also in lunar and Martian gravities and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO This is a very long-term low-priority project since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude Furthermore using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation and the sample size So I propose LabRatSat a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon Earth-Mars Earth-asteroid etc trips The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface AFter several orbital missions have been flown follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface testing out the actual environment at low cost before billions are spent on astronauts 3 By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills Once in place robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs inject fuel etc Once the fleet is working it can be spun off to commercial company s who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards By applying the successful constellation strategy and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost For a fraction of SSF 's pricetag we can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study life 's adaptation to a much large more representative variety of space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and if needed in special-purpose orbits N.B. we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return The descendants of LabRatSat 's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost

science,sci.electronics,There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett-packard Older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side viewed from front of the printer Newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide The black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out There was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation HP placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism I did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer I do n't have the information handy I suggest contacting your nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade I upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500 The kit was fairly expensive You are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much Upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill but no soldering Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts Contact your HP service center for further information The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from the PCL used by laser printers especially the newer laser printers The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line This makes no material difference for lasers but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster As you might guess the result is hideously slow printing The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior From the way Wordperfect works this would not be easy to change Windows Wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory An uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 Kbytes but the printer needs about 300K of memory for its internal house-keeping Laserjet IV models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations Deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds This is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer The presumption of course being that the laser printer has completed its warm-up cyle Until ink chemistry is changed wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable I wo n't use the word impossible but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely Chosing an appropriate paper type helps but does not eliminate the problem Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges mitigating the material waste problem to a degree Energy waste could use more work Warm-up times have decreased allowing stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet IV Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system The image drum is good for approximately 100K copies It is a very nice print engine I wish HP used the Kyocera engine Kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of HP 's laser printers The pick-up pressure rollers are subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out The usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from HP service Replacement cost for the transport is almost 200 The feed rollers are not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer It depends upon the application which printer is best for you If you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output the deskjet is a very good choice As noted the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use

religion,soc.religion.christian,The two historic facts that I think the most important are these 1 If Jesus did n't rise from the dead then he must have done something else equally impressive in order to create the observed amount of impact 2 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so it would have discredited the Christians

religion,soc.religion.christian,Much deletion He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and be like gods Eating of the tree of life would not take away the effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge Is there any reason to assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had already attained to eternal life If so what basis is there for saying that this was taken away from them To me the wages of sin are a spiritual death not necessarily a physical death I can attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience I suspect that many others could attest to this as well Peace Will

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Well it really is n't this cut and dry but as a Jay fan the thing I feared worst has happened The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start Williams B in CF I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation which is much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they 'd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience Granted Witt might be good but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the Jays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff The Orioles should also be there in the end

religion,soc.religion.christian,jwindley cheap.cs.utah.edu Jay Windley writes This is curious I read in _EH_ The Lord imparted the gift of knowledge to James the Just to John and Peter after his resurrection these delivered it to the rest of the apostles and they to the seventy of whom Barnabas was one Eusebius _Ecclesiastical History_ It seems that the Lord imparted the gift of knowledge not that the Lord imparted secret information I 'm afraid that I can not find this portrayal in _EH_ I do n't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain gnostics had the wrong gnosis The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus statements whilst if there were any at all that attempted to pervert the sound doctrine of the saving gospel they were yet skulking in dark retreats Favorably interpreted Just in looking at two of the four references that you gave I have the _EH_ handy Irenaeus and the _Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for I see no room for such 'interpretations And any such 'interpretation still falls short of an equivalence to the Temple Ceremonies The links for Jay 's using _EH_ for support are imparting the gift of knowledge imparted secret information being given secret signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven But there is not enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call this favorable interpretation It appears to be closer to fabrication

politics,talk.politics.misc,"THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April 13 1993 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH IN GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING Chamber of Commerce Building Washington D.C. 8:30 P.M. EDT SECRETARY RILEY Good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April You know today is April 13th In 1743 Thomas Jefferson was born 250 years ago I think that 's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been of course a person who has been one that we 've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country The success of our democracy according to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system His philosophy of government his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening Tonight we 're so pleased to have with us President Clinton He 's come over from the White House to join us in the Chamber of Commerce studios Mr. President it 's good to have you We thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich And Bob it 's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also I have some questions for our two guests and I 'm sure many of you do too So please call us if there 's something that you 'd like to ask The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782 In Washington D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171 I believe the President has a few words that he might want to share with us And Mr. President I 'll ask you to do that at this time It 's great to have you THE PRESIDENT Thank you very much Mr. Secretary I 'm glad to be here with my friends Dick Riley and Bob Reich also members of my Cabinet at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making along with its Center for Work Force Preparation to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts recognizing that without an educated work force we ca n't grow this economy or remain competitive and recognizing that we all have to work together business and government labor and educators to make things happen This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together And if you 'll forgive me a little home state pride I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart Corporation headquartered in Bentonville Arkansas for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight I appreciate that a lot as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you I have tried as hard as I could to move toward constructive change for this country Secretary Riley talked about this being Thomas Jefferson 's 250th birthday If Thomas Jefferson believed in anything he believed in these three things first in education second in real personal liberty freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of the press and third in the absolute imperative of changing as times change If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this beautiful city which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times For us here in America that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world We 're here to talk about that tonight about what we can do to educate and train our people better Unless we do that none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government even to bring the budget into balance even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs will last in the long run We also have to have people who can carry their load And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime It 's not just important what you know but what you can learn And if I might I 'd like to close just by emphasizing we 're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition And we 're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time Dick I think I ought to stop there That 's a good place we can begin I think the discussion SECRETARY RILEY Thank you so much Mr. President Each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals And tonight we 'll focus on goal five and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work This week the Education Department and the Labor Department are hosting a conference here in Washington D.C. called Summer Challenge a program of work and learning to America 's youth The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton 's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country Mr. President let 's talk a minute you alluded to it somewhat about the Summer Youth Challenge Your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs And why in your words is that so important THE PRESIDENT I think it 's important for two reasons First of all a lot of the young people we 're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning And while we want them to have a good experience with a real job we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime And that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before Secondly we want to help these young people progress not only in terms of work but in terms of learning We want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners And we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school or at work or in college as they go on SECRETARY RILEY Well I think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids that gap that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year is really even greater Secretary Reich of course you have training programs throughout the year And I wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training SECRETARY REICH Well what we 've learned Mr. Secretary is that for many young people whether it 's for the summer or for the year actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning Many young people for example have a lot they have a difficult time learning geometry But when they actually are there building something or working on something and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry they understand what it 's used for And a lot of young people just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly terribly important It 's important during the summer but it 's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer SECRETARY RILEY Thank you Mr. President you 've called for a youth apprenticeship program school-to-work transition And I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing THE PRESIDENT Well first of all let 's talk about why it 's important Most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma If you look at the last 10 years the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade The young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade because they were n't productive they were n't more valuable to their employers So we think America has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but do n't go on to college make a transition to work which includes two years of further training either in a community college a vocational setting or perhaps on the job And what I have done in this budget as you know is to give you and Secretary Reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community based on the needs of the economy in any given area It could revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and the earnings of American workers SECRETARY REICH I should add Mr. President I think you know this from your experience in Arkansas and many of the people watching this program that the business community and educators labor groups are already in many of our communities many of our states building a school-to-work transition program In fact there 's an awful lot of ferment a lot of excitement The people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that And more power to them Secretary Riley and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there SECRETARY RILEY Bob we 're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep the co-op learning career academies And what features all those programs that deal with this subject what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that are important SECRETARY REICH Well one thing that we 've seen and you and I have been working at this for a long time and you much longer than I we 've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential And I 'm so delighted that we 're doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these kinds of programs training education retraining and we 've aimed to work very closely with the Chamber The business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators community colleges technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future Communities have got to come together I mean this is one of the most important things You 've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together You know too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here labor groups over here and everybody is talking but they 're not really working together in a common strategy And the third and final ingredient I would say Dick would be a commitment to excellence a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence This is not a tracking program we 're talking about for kids who are not going to make it This is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for If they want to go on beyond that to four-year college that 's fine That ought to be permissible But we 're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs the foundation skills for on-the-job learning And again those are the critical components It 's already being done THE PRESIDENT I think if I might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home the business community has a critical role to play not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here 's what ought to be taught but also in monitoring that excellence If you have the right sort of partnership there the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them So I think that 's very important And when we try to if you will fill in the blanks at the federal level trying to set some standards and provide some funds one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs because that 's really what 's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile SECRETARY RILEY That 's great We 've been talking of course about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall But let 's talk just a moment about long-term school reform It 's something especially close to me Mr. President I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be coming forth before too long THE PRESIDENT Well as you know back when you and I were both governors we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals that the governors drafted along with representatives of President Bush 's administration back in 1989 And what we 're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in Congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners too meet those goals making sure that when by 2000 people show up for school ready to learn that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate that children at the 4th 8th and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they 're supposed to know that they are second to none in math and science that are schools are safe disciplined and drug-free And of course the fifth goal I took them out of line to say this the last is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country And each one of those goals there 's a national role a state role a school role school district role and a private sector role And what you 've attempted to do in this bill you 're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we 're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet It 's very exciting So far as I know nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job I 'm really excited about it SECRETARY RILEY Well I am too And I think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts all driven by high standards That 's the point Bob let me ask you one question and then we 'll get to the telephone calls It 's about the same subject We have of course skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000 and I wonder if you would comment on that SECRETARY REICH Well you know we have 75 percent of our young people who do n't graduate from college Very often they do n't have very many alternatives They do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs Everybody does n't have to go to college Other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical preprofessional skills We can do it in this country If you do n't go to four-year college you 're not a loser And we want to develop those national skill standards We 're going to be working with the states with the Education Department with a lot of private industry in developing those standards And I think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around as well as our business community SECRETARY RILEY Well that 's great Why do n't we go ahead and go to the telephone We have a call I see Mayor Bruce Todd of Austin Texas Q Yes Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and Riley we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today We have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative Let me simply say amen to some of the comments made already We agree with much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken and are very supportive We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years We expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance Much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments so we must be thinking alike But the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day would be appropriate We know summertime is important Year-round is even more important And what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis And perhaps more importantly how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative That 's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort SECRETARY RILEY Mr. President THE PRESIDENT I think I 'll give everybody a chance to answer the question Bruce but let me first thank you for calling and thank you for all the great work that you 're doing in Austin I 've seen some of it and I 've always been very impressed First with regard to the summer program we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector too We hope that Secretary Reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer And we 're working on that Secondly in the program that I have presented to the Congress over the next five years what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that 's quite substantial for job training programs for school-to-work programs all of which give heavy heavy weight to local community input just the question you asked but do provide some federal investment dollars which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis And I will say again to echo what Secretary Reich said a moment ago to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning An awful lot of young people actually have quite high IQs but actually learn so much better when they 're doing than when they 're reading or just listening So we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent and we hope that if the whole budget passes and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200 actually in the budget and some revenue raisers and some new money for education and training that we 'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question Bob do you want to say anything SECRETARY REICH Well you took most of the words out of my mouth Mr. President as usual But let me just add one thing and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college in addition to the school-to-work program simply is the availability of jobs And we 've got to get this economy moving again obviously It 's terribly important to get this recovery program to get the economy back on track That 's sort of the prerequisite to everything else If we do n't get the economy back on track we have I think this is the 16th correct me if I 'm wrong Mr. President I think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater This is a jobless recovery A lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in June And even if we did everything right they would have a very very hard time getting jobs SECRETARY RILEY Thank you both Of course Goals 2000 will be a permanent long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year It will involve if passed and we certainly hope it will be action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways And then the state with all the various school districts a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement And I think everybody will see a great energy out there once we get that moving The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann New York Doctor Q Good evening Mr. Secretary It is a pleasure to be on with you this evening As you may know bridging the school and work has been central to La Guardia 's educational program since its inception in the 1970s and that includes the college the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus and the linkages we have forged with the local schools We have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy And over the years we 've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work And these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace with providing all students early exposure to careers as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills and lastly the critical role of the liberal arts particularly in the development of high performance competencies My question then is How can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience And what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration SECRETARY RILEY Well thank you very much I think and we 'll get a response from you all on that and very interesting work going on there We 're going to have three people our next guests on the program this evening that will be some specialists in that area that you 're speaking and I 'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later You all care to comment any comments you might have THE PRESIDENT I 'd just like to say if I might one thing I want to reemphasize this and I do n't think I 'm being as clear about it as I 'd like although I think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than I. I think this whole concept of applied academics is very important And I think that we have to basically abolish what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning I think we should keep the liberal arts going I think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program SECRETARY REICH It seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students They 're important for all students It 's not just a special group of students that needs them Some of the experiments that I 've seen around the United States Dick I 'm sure you 've seen them as well are mainstream experiments They 're mainstreaming all the students At 11th and 12th grades they 're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program And again the kids can either go on to college if they want they can go on to technical community they can go on to an entirely a large variety of possibilities and career directions But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom within our schools SECRETARY RILEY Thank you very much I think that 's going to be the last call that we have time for Mr. President I think you 've got to move on to another matter and I want to thank you and Secretary Reich for being here We appreciate your time and your ideas and it 's been a tremendous help to us"

religion,talk.religion.misc,The primary problem in human nature is a fragmentation of being Humans are in a state of tension a tension of opposites Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures Man was created with the order to become a god Those were the words of St Basil in the fourth century What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature In the Eastern Orthodox Church this is called theosis or deification One can also say that man was created to be whole i.e spirit soul and body operating in unison The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other the world and the Creator That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves Immediately guilt and fear was manifested in their lives They become bound to hardship toil and suffering This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness If it were to receive this self-awareness the knowledge of good and evil its paradisiac state would also be destroyed Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God who did not desire that His masterpiece mankind be a blissful idiot God must have known that for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites There is no other way to achieve union with God Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities He was the perfectly integrated individual reconciling the opposites and making it possible for us to be integrated i.e to become God not in His essence but in His energies The opposites is THE Christian problem The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24 And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25

politics,talk.politics.guns,Unworthy of comment Nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty That is undeniable truth My heart bleeds just as much as yours for the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities to do so My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up and started dropping in tear gas early in the morning I do not think this However if they did set the fire which started in more than one place and spread very quickly then they got what they wanted and put into motion themselves I see the BATF is going to be investigated by the Justice Dept and likely by Arlen Spectre and congress This is good They have bungled the affair from the start

religion,soc.religion.christian,Well it was n't that way for Enoch and Elijah both of whom were translated directly into heaven It 's beyond my grasp why some object that Mary who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved She was after all Mother of God full of grace and immaculate And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus and in St. Andrew of Crete among others And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation even though they broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon It might be argued by some Protestants that the Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up but the Monophysites put a big hole in that notion as they also hold the belief and they split from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing as far as is known much has been lost from the time of the Fathers

recreation,rec.autos,I do n't remember the formula 's off hand as it has been awhile since I took aerodynamics and have n't used the stuff since The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle 's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance Since drag opposes the vehicle 's motion the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel Anyway since the geometery of an auto is rather complex the Drag pressure coeffiecent etc is either found experimentaly or using a numerical method anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is Cd d/ q 2R where d is the drag force q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder To get a rough very rough estimate you can set R at 1/2 the car's width q at the car 's speed and knowing the Cd find the drag force that the car would need to overcome

Helsingius 8.1 What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites is anon.penet.fi operated by julf penet.fi for several months who has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment Including anonymized mail Usenet posting and return addresses no encryption Send mail to help penet.fi for information Hal Finney

server finger site address for information Notes Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often running without site administrator knowledge Liability issues are wholly unresolved So far all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP software see the question on cryptography Encryption aspects message text destination address replies vary between sites Multiple chaining alias unlinking and address encryption are mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time 8.2 What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity Users Use anonymity only if you have to Frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others Do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on Usenet such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups If posting large files be attentive to bandwidth considerations Remember simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers The alt' hierarchy is preferred Give as much information as possible in the posting i.e references etc Remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle Be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it Test the system by sending anonymized mail to yourself Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege Be considerate and respectful of other 's objections to anonymity Hit-and-run anonymity should be used with utmost reservation Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead Be courteous to the system operator who may have invested large amounts of time be personally risking his account or dedicating his hardware all for your convenience Operators Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an introductory file that is sent to new users Have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it State clearly what logging and monitoring is occurring Describe your background interest and security measures Will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz-faire Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas What if a user is blackmailing someone through your service What if a user posts suicidal messages through your service Remember your users trust you to protect them In the site introductory note give clear examples of situations where you will take action and what these actions will be e.g warn the user limit anonymity to email or posting only revoke the account 'out the user contact local administrator etc Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware Address the bandwidth limitations of your site Report candidly and thoroughly all bugs that have occurred Work closely with users to isolate and fix bugs Address all bugs noted below under in stability of anonymity Document the stability of the site -how long has it been running What compromises have occured Why are you running it What is your commitment to it Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages Include an address for complaints ideally appended to every outgoing item Consult a lawyer about your liability Be committed to the long-term stability of the site Be prepared to deal with complaints and hate mail addressed to you If you do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system adminstrator consult those who do and are Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups If possible query group readers Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message format that can be screened effectively by kill files Ensure the key text Anon is somewhere in every header Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from physical and network-based attacks and infiltrations Readers Do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he is posting anonymously make blanket condemnations that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons e.g its volume is heavy or increasing React to the anonymous information unemotionally Abusive posters will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate responses Sometimes the most effective response is silence Notify operators if very severe abuses occur such as piracy harassment extortion etc Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they offend you personally Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the idea of anonymity itself Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings should be barred from particular groups because no possible or conceivable need exists References See e.g ftp.eff.org /pub/academic/anonymity This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual privacy and the use of handles It accepts the need of a system operator to know the name of a user but suggests that the use of a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a letter to the editor The article concludes with a set of guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous 8.3 How do I kill anonymous postings James Thomas Green jgreen zeus.calpoly.edu Try putting this in your kill file /Anon/h j /Anonymous/h j This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that contain Anon or Anonymous in them Not perfect and won't kill followups Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask anonymous postings under which the above method will not work so far this practice is not widespread but it may become more common as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering 8.4 What is the history behind anonymous posting servers Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity is almost the preferred method of communication such as talk.abortion and alt.sex.bondage One of the first was one by Dave Mack started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage Another early one was wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut Gilgut Enterprises but was disbanded due to lack of funds The system provided anonymous return addresses n7kbt.rain.com John Opalko took up the functions of this server including reinstating the anonymous alias file The group alt.personals has been chewing through servers like there 's no tomorrow Spurred by the disappearance of wizvax and interested in researching the idea Karl Kleinpaste Karl_Kleinpaste godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu developed his own system from scratch in six hours By this time the idea of extending the server to new more mainstream groups was starting to emerge and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request by multiple users for anonymity in other groups The intended advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group support with a single anon identifier across all This was arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus against it K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a fire extinguisher to squelch or plonk abusive users in response to complaints and used this in three cases Nevertheless after a few months of intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his server Even as restricted as it was my system was subjected to abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the facilities staff here Such abuses started right after it was created In ~Nov 1992 Johan Helsingius julf penet.FI set up the most controversial anonymous site to date anon.penet.fi is based on scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized mail posting and return addresses He initially wanted to confine the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide accessability in response to 'lots of international requests J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological opposition e.g by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium abuses by anonymous posters tend to have higher visibility than routine abuses His total commitment to preservation of anonymity is also controversial For example in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb 1993 an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via anon.penet.fi to sci.astro Despite that the transcript had been posted in the same place up to a year earlier then non-anonymously and actually originated not with the poster but a New York news tabloid subsequent responses consisted largely of vociferous outrage at the poster 's use of anonymity reverberating through many newsgroups The original poster using the same anonymous handle later conceded that the story seemed likely to have been fabricated suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceived association with the item The ensuing commotion generated queries for the original article by late-entering readers The anonymous user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his detractors Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news operators J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the fire extingisher and the group bouncer mechanisms that limit the scope of the service As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is best described as inundated it has registered over 13,000 users in its initial three months of operation forwards ~3000 messages a day and approximately 5 of all Usenet postings are anonymized through the site The immense popularity is probably largely due to the capability for global anonymity which has allowed users to find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993 At one point K. Kleinpaste threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operators to send out revocation commands on all messages originating from the site J. Helsingius has also alluded to threats of flooding the server The server has crashed several times at least once due to a saturation mailbombing through it by an anonymous user Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5 hours per day answering email requests alone associated with the service 's administration In response to the serious threats he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encouraged his users to defend the service publicly Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by cypherpunks J. Helsingius has identified many security weaknesses and valuable new features for the service and is currently in the process of code development and testing He is planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon to handle the voluminous load and is considering integrating a new system with very sophisticated functionality including multiple email aliases alias allocation control public-key encryption etc A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec. 1992 by D. Clunie dclunie pax.tpa.com.au that used cryptography in both directions to/from the server for the highest degree of confidentiality seen so far However it was running on a public access account and he had to shut it down after only several weeks upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately originating from NSF representatives D. Clunie has released the software to the public domain Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to whistleblowing on government abuses has received wide and focused attention and group formation is currently underway In the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable digital signatures The traffic may eventually reach reporters in the mainstream news media deltorto aol.com has volunteered to attack multiple aspects of this project including distributing easy-to-read documentation on posting anonymization and encryption See also sections on views on anonymous posting below and what is going on with anon.penet.fi in this document Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste Karl_Kleinpaste godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu David Clunie dclunie pax.tpa.com.au and Johan Helsingius julf penet.fi for contributions here 8.5 What is the value of anonymity KONDARED PURCCVM.BITNET I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the content of one 's message Sure lot of anonymous posts are abusive or frivolous but in most cases these are by users who find the anon facility novel Once the novelty wears off they are stopping their pranks morgan engr.uky.edu Wes Morgan I do n't mind seeing the miscellaneous hatred/prejudice/racism those things are part of our nature However the notion of providing anonymity 's shield for these ideas repulses me If they have such strong feelings why ca n't they put their name s on their postings Quite frankly I loathe communication with people who refuse to use their names dclunie pax.tpa.com.au David Clunie Many seem to question the value of anonymity But who are they to say what risks another individual should take There is no question that in this rather conservative society that we live in holding certain views making certain statements adopting a certain lifestyle are likely to result in public censure ridicule loss of status employment or even legal action Given the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdictions from where the many contributors to usenet post who knows what is legal and what is not Some say that anonymous posters are cowards and should stand up and be counted Perhaps that is one point of view but what right do these detractors have to exercise such censorship From doug cc.ysu.edu Doug Sewell Why is it censorship to not expect someone to speak for themselves without the cloak of anonymity This is at best a lame argument You tell me why what you have to say requires anonymity And you tell me why the wishes of a majority of non-anonymous users of a newsgroup should be disregarded when they do n't want anonymous posts Anonymous users have LESS rights than any others They are not legitimate usenet participants I would not honor RFDs CFVs control messages or votes from one brad clarinet.com Brad Templeton I can think of no disadvantage caused by anon posting sites that does n't already exist other than the fact that they do make more naive net users who do n't know how to post anonymously the old way more prone to do it From mandel netcom.com Tom Mandel I can not speak for others but I regard anonymous postings in a serious discussion as pretty much worthless views that hide behind the veil of anon are hardly worth the trouble of reading n8729 anon.penet.fi Hank Pankey Since I began posting anonymously to show support for general principles of personal privacy I have been subject to far more abuse and attack than I ever received before People seem to find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they don't know Perhaps it 's easier to pretend that there is no person behind the email address who feels the sting of abusive comments Anonymity does hinder some methods of controlling other posters' actions People who seek such control will naturally oppose it From 00acearl leo.bsuvc.bsu.edu Instead of making this a free-er medium by allowing posters to protect themselves with anonymity simply require that all posters be prepared to discuss their sources of information and take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble This seems to be the way things are currently done xtkmg trentu.ca Kate Gregory In misc.kids there are three threads going on started by anonymous posters One was about changing jobs so as to work less hours job sharing and so on from a woman who did n't want anyone at her current place of work to know she was thinking of looking for work elsewhere The next was from a woman who is thinking of having a baby sometime soon and does n't want coworkers friends family etc etc to know all about it but who wants advice The third is about sex after parenthood actually this was started by people posting in the usual way but then it was pointed out that the anonymous posting service might let more people participate Misc.kids does n't seem to be suffering any harm from the presence of anonymous posters in fact it seems to have been helped by it hoey zogwarg.etl.army.mil Dan Hoey While there has never been any real security against anonymous or forged postings on Usenet the process has until now been sufficiently inconvenient error-prone and undocumented to limit its use by persons who have not learned the culture of the net On the other hand a recent use of the anonymous posting service on sci.math seemed seemed to be a student asking help on a homework problem It has now been attributed to a teacher asking for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teaching guide He says his news posting is broken so he is using the anonymous service as a mail-to-news gateway Karl Barrus elee9sf Menudo.UH.EDU Some argue that the opinions of the people who hide behind a veil of anonymity are worthless and that people should own up to their thoughts I agree with the latter point in an ideal world we would all be sitting around engaging in Socratic dialogues freely exchanging our opinions in an effort to learn But in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for your thoughts or ridicule you But we live in a world where the people who do n't agree with you may try to harm you Let 's face it some people are n't going to agree with your opinion no matter how logically you try to present it or how reasoned out it may be This is sad since it does restrict people from voicing their opinions red redpoll.neoucom.edu Richard E. Depew The consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service such as that at anon.penet.fi seems sufficiently corrosive of the trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment should be ended Perhaps the next time the question comes up we can say We tried it we learned it does more harm than good and we stopped it From C96 vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de Alexander EICHENER anonymous posting has not created major problems aside from angering irate people like you who would rather ban anonymous/pseudonymous posting altogether because real men can stand up for what they said or comparable puerile arguments as others have brought up dave elxr.jpl.nasa.gov Dave Hayes What a primal example of human nature I have three questions for you folks Do people really say different things to each other based upon whether their identity is or is n't known Are people really so affected by what other people say that the verbage is labeled abuse Most importantly on a forum that prizes itself on the freedom of communication that it enjoys is there really such a thing as freedom of communication From terry geovision.gvc.com Terry McGonigal sigh Just how many anon services are needed Will everybody start running one soon What 's the purpose Who stands to benefit when there are N anon services then 2 N then N^2 out there Where has this sudden fasination with anon services come from For better or IMHO worse it looks like we'er gon na get stuck with these things and as much as I do n't like the idea of services like this becoming the norm I do n't really think there 's much to be done since it 's obvious that anyone who wants to can set one up with a bit of work Karl_Kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu Karl Kleinpaste Weak reasoning With freedom comes responsibility dave elxr.jpl.nasa.gov Dave Hayes Responsibility is n't real if it is enforced True responsibilty comes with no coercion 8.6 Should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed morgan engr.uky.edu Wes Morgan I will be the first to admit that I hold some controversial opinions indeed I 'm sure that none of us are completely orthodox in our opinions However I 've received hundreds of anonymous email messages over the last few years fewer than 20 of them were reasonable posts made with good motives It 's getting more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity at all the abusers are once again lousing things up for those who truly need the service or those who would put it to good use I 'm not suggesting that we should ban anonymous servers as I've said there are several situations in which anonymity is a Good Thing tm However the notion that anonymity 's shield should be automatically extended to every Usenet discussion is ridiculous it opens the door to further abuse twpierce unix.amherst.edu Tim Pierce Of course how does one determine whether a group requests the service A flat majority of posters voting in favor A positive margin of 100 votes Or what No one speaks for a newsgroup I 'm not convinced by the arguments that an anonymous posting service for all newsgroups is inherently a bad idea simply because it 's a diversion from the status quo Since the status quo previously permitted anonymous posting to no newsgroups any anonymous posting service would reject the status quo It is facist to suggest that a newsgroup is best able to decide whether it wants to allow anonymous postings instead of having them forced upon them by an service administrator ogil quads.uchicago.edu Brian W. Ogilvie The service provides a mechanism for forwarding mail to the original poster Since most Usenet readers do n't know John Smith from Jane Doe except by their opinions and their address the effect of having an anonymous posting to which mail replies can be directed is minimal except for those who personally know the poster and the lack of anonymity could be serious Any mechanism like this is liable to abuse but the benefits as well as the costs must be weighed Limiting the service to alt groups or specific groups would not help those who want advice on sensitive issues in more 'professional newsgroups From tarl sw.stratus.com Tarl Neustaedter An additional point is that some of us find anonimity in technical matters to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forums has different meanings If I get a phone call from someone who wo n't identify himself I hang up If I get U.S. mail with no return address it goes into the garbage unopened If someone accosts me in the street while wearing a mask I back away carefully and expecting violence In a technical discussion anonimity means that the individual is n't willing to associate himself with the matter being discussed which discredits his utterances and makes listening to them a waste of time Anonimity leads to fun psych experiments the literature is filled with all the various things that people will do anonymously that they wo n't otherwise Including one notorious study involving torture that would not have passed today 's ethical standards Fun stuff in any case FINE LEAVE US OUT OF IT From jbuck forney.berkeley.edu Joe Buck You obviously have never submitted an article to a refereed journal where you will receive anonymous reviews through a server the editor that behaves much like the one in Finland e.g you may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity Your comparison of someone who wants to express him/herself on a technical issue anonymously with a person who approaches you on a dark street with a ski mask is just emotionally overwrought nonsense such posters pose no physical threat to you jik mit.edu J. Kamens It seems obvious to me that the default should be not to allow anonymous postings in a newsgroup The Usenet has always operated on the principle that the status quo should be kept unless there 's a large number of people who want to change it If someone REALLY needs to post a message anonymous in a newsgroup in which this usually is n't done they can usually find someone on the net to do this for them They do n't need an automated service to do it and the automated service is by its nature incapable of making the judgment call necessary to decide whether a particular posting really needs to be anonymous From twpierce unix.amherst.edu Tim Pierce For any newsgroup you name I bet I can envision a scenario involving a need for secrecy If an accurate content-based filter of each anonymous posting could be devised to screen out those that do n't require secrecy wonderful But it ca n't be done From lhp daimi.aau.dk Lasse Hiller|e Petersen If a newsgroup wants to be noise- and nuisance-free then it should call for moderation This should happen on a per-newsgroup basis and not as a general USENET ban on anonymous postings Of course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all anonymous postings and could be achieved automatically It would still be _moderation_ Personally I would prefer moderation criteria being based on actual content David A. Clunie dclunie pax.tpa.com.au If a group does n't want to receive certain posts it should become moderated there are clearly defined mechanisms on non-alt groups for this to take place An automated moderator excluding posts from certain eg anonymous sites or individuals could easily be established If anyone wants to take such a draconian approach then they are welcome to do so and good luck to them I doubt if I will be reading their group From dave frackit.UUCP Dave Ratcliffe What possible need would someone have for posting anonymously to a sci group Sure most adults are willing to post under their own names Why would they want to hide behind an anonymous posting service Ashamed of what they have to say or just trying to rile people without fear of being identified Anonymous posting have their place in CERTAIN groups If I or anyone else needs to tell you what those groups are then you've been on another planet breathing exotic gases for too long From Karl_Kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu It 's bloody fascinating that all the proponents of unimpeded universal anon posting access ca n't seem to find any middle ground at all Why is there such a perception of absolutism Where does this instant gratification syndrome come from I want anon access and I want it NOW Who are the control freaks here From 00acearl leo.bsuvc.bsu.edu Remember this is a newsgroup for posters writing about SCIENTIFIC issues Anonymous discussion of scientific issues leads to bad science From noring netcom.com Jon Noring Though many have personal philosophical arguments against anonymous posters their arguments have not been compelling enough to convince me that omni-newsgroup anonymous posting should be banned or severely restricted Though I can not prove it it seems to me that those who do not like anonymous posting in principle do so for reasons that are personal read psychological discomfort rather than for reasons related to maintaining the integrity of Usenet Remember it is impossible to be able to ascertain all the conceivable and legitimate motives for anonymous posting to newsgroups one normally would not deem to be sensitive in general I fear even letting newsgroup readers vote on either allowing or not allowing anonymous posting since a priori they can not know all the motives of legitimate posters and I do not believe that any system should ever be instituted that would inhibit the posting of legitimate and informative posts I personally do n't believe that pseudonymous postings are appropriate in a serious discussion area If there is a LEGITIMATE reason for concealing the posters identity perhaps but simply because they 're not so sure if they want their name attached does n't qualify as LEGITIMATE in my book Oh and if you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous postings please enlighten me sderby crick.ssctr.bcm.tmc.edu Stuart P. Derby Three of our the U.S. 's founding fathers Madison Hamilton and Jay seemed to think anonymous posting was OK The Federalist papers were originally printed in New York newspapers with authorship attributed to Publius I wonder if you would find their purpose LEGITIMATE 8.7 What should system operators do with anonymous postings From emcguire intellection.com Ed McGuire I would like to know how to junk all articles posted by the anonymous service currently being discussed Ideally I would actually tell my feed site not to feed me articles posted by the anonymous service Assuming the C News Performance Release what is a simple way to accomplish this Or where should I look to learn how to do it myself From dclunie pax.tpa.com.au David Clunie That 's a bit draconian is n't it Have your users unanimously decided that they would like you to do this or have you decided for them From emcguire intellection.com Ed McGuire Good question Nobody has decided I have no definite plan to do this just wanted the technical data Carl Kleinpaste Karl_Kleinpaste godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu were I to be in the position of offering such a service again my promises of protection of anonymity would be limited Not on the basis of personal opinion of what gets posted but on the basis of postings which disrupt the smooth operation of the Usenet The most obvious and direct recourse would be to out' the abusive individual Less drastic possibilities exist the software supports a fire extinguisher by which individuals can be prevented from posting john iastate.edu John Hascall Since when is Usenet a democracy If someone wants to run an anonymous service that 's their business If you want to put that host in your killfile that 's your business If a newsadmin wants to blanket-drop all postings from that site that 's between them and the other people at that site If everyone ignores a service the service effectively does n't exist From jik athena.mit.edu Jonathan I. Kamens NNTP servers that allow posting from anyone are NOT a service to the net They do the net a disservice Terminal servers have the same problems as open NNTP servers they allow people who want to do illegal/immoral/unethical things on the Internet to do so without accountability There are by now public access sites all over this country if not all over the world that allow very inexpensive access to the Usenet and the Internet There is no reason for NNTP servers to allow anyone to post messages through them and there is no reason for terminal servers to allow anyone to connect to them and then make outbound connections through them Perhaps when it was harder to get to the Internet or the Usenet open servers could be justified but not now jbotz mtholyoke.edu Jurgen Botz I think that what these points show clearly is that an anonymous posting service has a great deal of responsibility both towards its clients and towards the Net as a whole Such a service should IMHO have a set of well-defined rules and a contract that its clients should sign under the terms of which they are assured anonymity From an8785 anon.penet.fi Is the problem that some are used to punishing posters who are upsetting in some vague way by complaining to the usually acquiescent sysadmin or organizations that the poster belongs to That surely is the most gutless approach to solving problems but my experience on the net shows that the same users who vilify anonymous postings are the first to write obsessively detailed grievances to the poster 's supervisor when his or her tranquility is disturbed by some intrusive or subversive post or another Anonymous postings prevent just this kind of intimidation From gandalf cyberspace.org Eric Schilling The main point I would like to make here is that while we can go through and revise the news sw to reject anon posts to technical newsgroups or some such thing I think the attempt will prove futile Each attempt to modify news can result in a changed approach by anon service providers to thwart the change I think this would be pointless From julf penet.fi Johan Helsingius I have tried to stay out of this discussion and see where the discussion leads But now I rally feel like I have to speak up I have repeatedly made clear that I do block users if they continue their abuse after having been warned In many cases the users have taken heed of the warning and stopped and in some cases even apologized in public And when the warning has not had the desired effect I have blocked a number of users I have also blocked access to groups where the readership has taken a vote to ban anonymous postings although I feel changing the newsgroup status to moderated is the only permanent solution for newsgroups that want to formalize discussion red redpoll.neoucom.edu Richard E. Depew Does this mean that you are volunteering to issue a Request For Discussion to ban anonymous postings or to moderate each of the 4000+ newsgroups that your server can reach I do n't think so but this illustrates the trouble that your server is causing please listen to the consensus of the news administrators in this group any newsgroup should be consulted before letting your server post messages to that group From C96 vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de Alexander EICHENER There is no pompous consensus of the news administrators here maybe you would like to invent one There is a sizeable number of people who are concerned about the possible and to a minor extent about the actual abuse of the server as it is configured now These concerns are respectable Johan is dealing with them There are some few who rage with foam before their mouth and condemn the service altogether And a number who defend it pointing out like Kate Gregory that even a group like misc.kids can benefit from pseudonymous postings From julf penet.fi Johan Helsingius I have answered a lot of personal mail related to server abuse and as a result of that blocked a number of abusive users I have also withdrawn the service from several newsgroups where the users have taken a vote on the issue I have not made any comments on news.admin.policy partly because the newly-implemented password feature as a emergency measure against a security hole has kept me really busy answering user queries the last two weeks and partly because I feel it is not for me to justify the service but for the users The problem with news.admin.policy is that the readership is rather elective representing people whith a strong interest in centralised control From hartman ulogic.UUCP Richard M. Hartman This seems to be a rather bigoted attitude I would consider that this group is for anyone who wishes to discuss how the net should be controlled Saying that we only have an interest in centralized control is a clear indication of bias You are perfectly welcome to join in the discussions here to promote your views on control jbuck ohm.berkeley.edu This whole debate is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing because even if you all decide to ban anonymous posting servers it is not enforceable The only people who conceivably could enforce retrictions are those that control the international links Policy changes should be made by cooperation not by attempting to dictate you need to persuade those who run the services to act like this through friendly persuasion not by trying to beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you do n't even have spp zabriskie.berkeley.edu Steve Pope I am finding this bias against pseudonymity boring Our friend posting through penet has a point The old guard would like to keep their network the way it always has been and this new thing these pseudonymous servers cuts into their turf So they whine and bitch about it and every time there 's the slightest abuse such as somebody 's .sig being too long they try to parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity I 'll go on record as saying three cheers for the admins at anon servers like penet pax and n7kbt and for all the access service providers who are willing to preserve their clients privacy And a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity mimir stein.u.washington.edu Al Billings I would n't help people get rid of anon postings as a group If you do n't like what someone says then you put THAT anon address in your kill file not all of them Of course if and when I get an anon site going I 'm just going to assign fake names like jsmith instead of anon5564 to avoid most of the hassles You 'll never know it is anonymous will you From anne alcor.concordia.ca Anne Bennett I must admit to some astonishment at this argument I see the value of anonymous postings under some circumstances yet believe strongly that these should be identified as such so that people who do not wish to read material from people who wo n't identify themselves do n't have to I fail to see what good you would be accomplishing and indeed surmise that you will cause many people inconvenience and annoyance by hiding the anonymity of postings from your anonymous site Would you care to justify where the hell you get the gall to try to prevent people from effectively filtering their news as they see fit From dclunie pax.tpa.com.au David Clunie I thought I was out of reach here in Australia too Unfortunately one of the US sites involved in the US/Aus feed complained to the Australian Academic Reasearch Network through whom my site is connected not about anything in particular just the concept of anonymous mail having no redeeming features and consuming a narrow bandwidth link with which I ca n't argue and that was that stop the service or face disconnection I consider the demise of my service to have been rather unfortunate and I wish the Finnish remailer luck It is a pity that there are very few if any similar services provided with in the US I guess that 's the benefit of having a constitution that guarantees one freedom of speech and a legal and political system that conspires to subvert it in the name of the public good 8.8 What is going on with anon.penet.fi run by J. Helsingius From Karl_Kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu Funny how beating the rest of the Usenet over the head with a stick is OK if it 's anon.penet.fi and universal anon access But somehow people on the other side of the same equation not even arguing to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some control applied to the abuses that manifest themselves aren't allowed to do that I have written to Johan several times in the last couple of weeks He used to reply to me quite readily After all I was the source of the software as originally delivered to him he used to be downright _prompt_ about replying to me Funny now he 's being an impolite bastard who does n't answer mail _at_all_ even when it consists of really very civil queries From julf penet.fi Johan Helsingius In your mail you told me you sent me one or more messages on Feb. 8th Feb 7th and 8th the server was down and the flood of mail that resulted from the server coming up again crashed my own mail host The problem was aggregated by an abusive user sending thousands of messages to another user filling up that users mailbox The bounce messages ended up in my mailbox overflowing my local disk as well I can only suppose that your message got lost in that hassle as I have tried to answer as much as possible of the anon-related messages I get from routine mis-addessed messages to complaints about the service On the average I spend 4-5 hours per day answering anon-related messages From Karl_Kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu Why is it that everybody else has to put up with the impoliteness and insensitivity of the misuse of anon.penet.fi Whose definitions of polite and sense apply and why Why is universal anon access considered to be within the realm of this fuzzy concept of politeness in the first place I think Johan has long since crossed the line into being a rude bastard and I told him so in private mail a little while ago At this point I deeply regret a having created an anonymous system supporting 1 newsgroup and b having given the code to Johan I did n't copyright it but I thought that some concept of politeness and good sense might follow it to new homes Interesting that Johan 's ideas of politeness and good sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine I could even cope with universal anon access _if_ Johan would be willing to engage in abuse control but somehow that seems to be outside the range of reality From julf penet.fi Johan Helsingius There is no way for me to convey how sad and upset your message made me I do to some extent understand your feelings but it still feels really bad Running the server requires getting used to a lot of flames but mindlessly abusive hate mail is so much easier to deal with than something like this as I do respect and value your views and opinions to a high degree No I 'm not asking for sympathy I just wanted you to know that I am really giving your views quite a lot of weight When I asked for the software I was actually only going to provide the service to scandinavian users But a lot of people requested that I keep the service open to the international community I now realize that I ought to have contacted you at that point to ask how you feel about me using your stuff in such a context Again I really want to apologise And I will replace the remaining few pieces of code thet still stem from your system Unfortunately there is no way to remove the ideas and structure I got from you Again I am really sorry that the results of your work ended up being used in a way that you do n't approve of And I will be giving a lot of hard thought to the possibility of shutting down the server alltogether From Karl_Kleinpaste cs.cmu.edu I think I 'm feeling especially rude and impolite If it 's good for Johan it 's good for me After all he did n't ask the greater Usenet whether universal anon access was a good idea he just did it Yes I 'm a seriously rude pain in the ass now and I think I 'll arm the Usenet Death Penalty slightly modified not for strategic whole-site attack but tactical assault just an 0-9 anon.penet.fi destruction Only outside alt too let 's say To parrot this line people have been doing things like the UDP that is cancelling others postings for years no one could ever stop them and it 's only politeness and good sense that has prevented them up to now In fact I have 8 people who have expressed privately the desire and ability to arm the UDP PS- No in fact there are not 8 newsadmins ready to arm the UDP It would be amusing to know how many people gulped hard when they read that though I do n't see it as any different from Johan 's configuration PPS- Now that I 've calmed some fears by the above PS There are 2 newsadmins ready to arm the UDP They 've asked for my code I have n't sent it yet Only one site would be necessary to bring anon.penet.fi to a screeching halt Anyone can implement the UDP on their own if they care to Politeness and good sense prevents them from doing so I wonder how long before one form of impoliteness brings on another form From julf penet.fi Johan Helsingius It would be trivially easy to bring anon.penet.fi to a screeching halt In fact it has happened a couple of times already But as we are talking threats here let me make one as well A very simple one If somebody uses something like the UDP or maliciously brings down anon.penet.fi by some other means it will stay down But I will let the users know why And name the person who did it OK As somebody said on this thread You have to take personal responsibility for your actions right From avs20 ccc.amdahl.com 134 Atul V Salgaonkar I am very grateful and appreciative of this service courtesey of penet.fi Some important questions about my personal life/career/job were resolved due to kind help of other people who had been thru similar situations In return I have also replied to anon postings where I thought I could make a positive contribution In general anon service is a great in my

Within a few months after the war began these Armenian guerrilla forces operating in close coordination with the Russians were savagely attacking Turkish cities towns and villages in the east massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time working to sabotage the Ottoman army 's war effort by destroying roads and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to ease Russian occupation The atrocities committed by the Armenian volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties The memoirs of many Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by

look out the window to see if there is a non-fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government in the East Now where is your non-existent list of scholars What a moronian During the First World War and the ensuing years 1914-1920 the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland How could you Because there is none Like conversing with a brick wall And you are not responding to what I am writing By the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation The persecutions culminated in 1914 The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland After one thousand years Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye Today x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia Today x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds You may assert whatever you wish Ditto The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an

all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers To one brought up as most Americans have been in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition the condition of the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable One readily reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate He also stated that they Armenians traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated

Muslim population exterminated by the Armenians Why Who gives a thunder about your pseudo-scholar jokes I'am arguing about the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II Any comment It could be perhaps your head was n't screwed on just right In 1941 while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In 1943 this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship 1918-1920 and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920 An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler 's policy of extermination of the Jews This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army Furthermore as McCarthy put it the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies October 30 1918 The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics Only the area called Cilicia around the Ottoman province of Adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the French The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks who could be expected to oppose their plans On April 19 1919 the British Army occupied Kars gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians then withdrew The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship even though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60 Muslim The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia Murder pillage genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads Therefore few Europeans were present to observe the genocide One British soldier Colonel Rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers saw what was occurring Rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population as their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed Come again These European Dashnags with headquarters in Berlin appealed to Why No wonder you are in such a mess Here are the Armenian sources on the Turkish Holocaust Why

religion,soc.religion.christian,If the Papacy is infallible and this is a matter of faith then the Pope can not be wrong If on the other hand this is not a matter of faith but a matter of Church law then we should still obey as the Pope is the legal head of the church In other words given the doctrine of infallibility we have no choice but to obey This is a primary problem in the Church today What you are saying is more or less heresy You might call it infallibilism It 's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does This is virtually all over the place especially in this country The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions When these conditions are not met he can make mistakes He can make big mistakes A couple historical examples come to mind Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church At one point during his career the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body though maybe not in so many words you have to treat Popes with respect even when they are wrong The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see and probably never set foot there This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did Another example is that of Pope John XXII a Pope of the Middle Ages He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church Though he did n't quite get around to defining it Now there 's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine The Pope 's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail even In the end he had to admit his mistake Shortly before he died he recanted His successor made the exact opposite idea a dogma of the Church If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects such as St. Robert Bellarmine a Doctor of the Church you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism

religion,soc.religion.christian,Vera Shanti Noyes writes Of course I believe in Predestination It 's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows among other passages Furthermore the Church has always taught predestination from the very beginning But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will Men freely choose the course of their life which is also affected by the grace of God However unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists I hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God 1 Timothy 2.4 For God must give enough grace to all to be saved But only the elect who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantees heaven This does not mean that those without that grace ca n't be saved it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need it as they had freely chosen hell People who are saved are saved by the grace of God and not by their own effort for it was God who disposed them to Himself and predestined them to become saints But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish Thus they were deserving of God s punishment as they had rejected their Creator and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit Well I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little for those He ca n't bless in the next life He blesses in this one And those He will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins Every sin incurs some temporal punishment thus God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it cf 2 Samuel 12.13-14 David 's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God 's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible Sodom and Gommorrah Moses barred from the Holy Land the slaughter of the Cannanites Annias and Saphira Jerusalem in 70 AD etc not a good parallel but i 'm going to go with it anyway why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may or may not be more We should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf Proverbs 24.11-12 but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved I do not think so but I am an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general But in the case of Bosnia I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved it would not be a just war Blessed after all are the peacemakers was what Our Lord said not the interventionists Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us

religion,talk.religion.misc,"Rick I think we can safely say 1 Robert is not the only person who understands the Bible and 2 the leadership of the LDS church historicly never has Let 's consider some personal interpretations and see how much trust we should put in Orthodox Mormonism which could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity In one of his attacks on Christians the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie said they thrash around in darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah He also said Christians are wrong to believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity God the Father and that Christ came into mortality as His Only Begotten Son McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter He said that Elohim is the Father and Jehovah is the Son Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three-in-one God it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten As with their concept that God is a Spirit this misinformation about the Gods of Heaven is untrue The fact is and it too is attested by Holy Writ that Elohim is the Father and that Jehovah is the Son who was born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ the promised Messiah Promised Messiah p. 100 Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about their three-in-one God and their belief that God is a Spirit as they are in their understanding of who Elohim and Jehovah are Before examining McConkie 's attack and its validity we shall read a few more statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words Elohim and Jehovah McConkie stated the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in the Old Testament as that ancient work is now published is the exalted name-title Jehovah Promised Messiah p. 367 _Elohim_ plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being God above all Gods Mormon Doctrine p. 224 Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who Elohim and Jehovah are the Apostle James E. Talmage stated _Elohim_ as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus Christ is the name-title of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ the Only Begotten in the flesh Jesus Christ Jesus the Christ p. 38 A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve apostles of the Mormon Church states that God the Eternal Father is designate d by the exalted name-title 'Elohim Articles of Faith p. 466 Christ in His preexistent antemortal or unembodied state was known as Jehovah Articles of Faith p. 471 Today Mormon leaders teach that Elohim in the OT refers to God the Father and Jehovah refers to Christ McConkie attacked Christians for saying Jehovah can refer to the Father He stressed that these two name-titles should not be changed around so that Christ is called Elohim and the Father is called Jehovah the Father is Elohim not Jehovah Jehovah is Christ and Christ is Jehovah they are one and the same person Promised Messiah p. 111 In the OT of the KJV of the Bible the Hebrew word Elohim is used to refer to the true God false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel When referring to the true God Elohim is translated with a capital G. When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel it is translated with a small g. It is translated four times as judges Exod 21:6 22:8-9 once as judge 1 Sam 2:25 twice as mighty Gen. 23:6 Exod 9:28 once as angels Ps 8:5 once as godly Mal 2:15 once as great Gen. 30:8 and once as very great 1 Sam 14:15 The word Jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word Adonai Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh However since Jehovah rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism this section will also use Jehovah instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that name Jehovah unlike Elohim is never used of false gods It is the personal name of the triune God of the Bible In the KJV Jehovah is rendered primarily LORD sometimes GOD and rarely Lord Now that we understand something about the words Elohim and Jehovah and their use by Mormon leaders we shall consider the Apostle McConkie 's attack on Christians for believing the Father is Jehovah In trying to prove that Jehovah refers exclusively to Christ McConkie cited several verses from the Bible Some of these verses and McConkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right Remember McConkie said the Father is not Jehovah He is only Elohim The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's interpretation of Ps 110:1 Of this verse he stated Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit and he testified The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool Ps 110:1 Two Lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other Who are they and what message is contained in this Messianic prophecy What think ye of Christ our Lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry Whose son is he Is Christ the Son of God or of someone else Is he to be born of a divine Parent or will he be as other men a mortal son of a mortal father That he was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the Jews And so they answered The Son of David David 's son Truly he was But he was more much more And so our Lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture asked How then doth David in spirit call him Lord saying The Lord said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool If David then call him Lord how is he his son That is if he is only the Son of David how is it that the great King acting under inspiration calls him Lord and worships him as such And we might add _Who is the other Lord the one who spake unto David 's Lord Can there be any question as to how Jesus is interpreting the words of the Psalm He is saying that it means Father said unto the Son Elohim said unto Jehovah_ sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry then I will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever Promised Messiah pp 101-102 emphasis added Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ p. 6 reads The Lord Elohim the Father said unto my Lord Jehovah the Son brackets in original McConkie clearly stated that it is Elohim the Father who is speaking to Jehovah the Son in this Psalm However when one looks at the Hebrew word translated LORD it becomes apparent that either the first LORD is not the Father or else the Father is Jehovah Either way McConkie is wrong The Psalm reads The LORD Jehovah said unto my Lord Adon Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool Ps 110:1 The first LORD in this verse is Jehovah who Mormonism says is Christ not the Father The second Lord is the Hebrew word Adon singular for Adonai meaning master or lord If the first LORD is the Father and the second Lord is the Son then the Father is Jehovah and the Son is Adon However if the Father is not Jehovah as McConkie claimed then the first LORD is Jehovah the Son but who then is Adon Obviously the Father is Jehovah in this Psalm and His Son is Adon Another example involves Isa 42:6 about which McConkie stated the following I the Lord have called thee in righteousness _Isaiah quoted the Father as saying of Christ_ and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles Isa 42:6 Promised Messiah p. 81 emphasis added McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads I the LORD Jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles Isa 42:6 According to McConkie I the LORD refers to the Father and thine and thee refer to Christ However the LORD who is speaking is Jehovah which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is Jehovah Another example involves Ps 22:7-8 Of these verses McConkie stated shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him Ps 22:7-8 _The fulfillment as Jesus hung on the cross_ is found in these words The chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said He saved others himself he can not save If he be the King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him He trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said I am the Son of God The thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth Matt 27:41-44 Promised Messiah pp 530-531 emphasis added Ps 22:7-8 reads as follows All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying He trusted on the LORD Jehovah that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment as Jesus hung on the cross That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Christ Who then was the LORD in whom he trusted It was Jehovah the Father Another example involves Ps 31:13 and Ps 41:9 Regarding them McConkie stated the following With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our Lord 's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was They took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life Ps 31:13 Mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me Ps 41:9 Promised Messiah p. 532 Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ 's arrest and judicial trials We shall first consider Ps 31 and then Ps 41 While McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps 31 verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter For I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life But I trusted in thee O LORD Jehovah I said Thou art my God Elohim Ps 31:13-14 McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ Verse 14 goes on to tell that He Christ trusted in the LORD who is called His God or Elohim Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is Elohim the Father Verse 14 however reveals that the Elohim of the man Jesus is Jehovah the Father In Ps 41 McConkie only quoted one verse however two verses will be considered in this examination Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me But thou O LORD Jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that I may requite them Ps 41:9-10 McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas role in Christ 's death Since it was Judas who was the familiar friend who lifted up his heel the pronouns mine I my and me in verse 9 must refer to Christ Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to thou which refers to the LORD Jehovah Then the pronouns me and I which refer to Christ are used again That means Christ was speaking to Jehovah the Father in these verses Another example involves McConkie 's following remark about Ps 110:4 One of the great Messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of David ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps 110:4 Promised Messiah p. 450 McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ The question is What in this verse refers to Christ The LORD Jehovah hath sworn and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps 110:4 Does the LORD which is Jehovah refer to Christ If McConkie is right and Jesus is Jehovah but the Father is not then the LORD would have to refer to Christ But who then is the one addressed as the priest forever after the order of Melchizedek The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ Heb 5:8-10 6:20 7 therefore the LORD Jehovah in Ps 110:4 is the Father Another example involves Isa 53:4-12 Of these verses McConkie stated Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah Isaiah said The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him Promised Messiah p. 234 emphasis added McConkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah However what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is Jehovah Verse 6 reads All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the LORD Jehovah hath laid on him Christ the iniquity of us all and verse 10 reads Yet it pleased the LORD Jehovah to bruise him Christ Obviously the LORD who laid on Christ the iniquity of us all and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called Jehovah in these verses Remember McConkie stated that some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity and that Christ came into mortality as His Only Begotten Son He called this concept misinformation that is untrue To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth two Scriptural references 2 Sam 7:14 Ps 2:7 will be examined McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic the Lord says of the Seed of David I will be his father and he shall be my son 2 Sam 7:14 In the second Psalm the whole of which is also clearly Messianic occurs this statement Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee Ps 2:7 Paul quotes both of these statements in Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the Son of God Promised Messiah p. 143 McConkie cited Heb 1:5 to show that 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 2:7 refer to Christ who would come as the Son of God Since McConkie first referenced 2 Sam 7:14 this examination will too However along with verse 14 verses 11-13 will also be included And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies Also the LORD Jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house And when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom He shall build an house for my name and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever I will be his father and he shall be my son 2 Sam 7:11-14 These verses teach that the LORD Jehovah would have a Son the Messiah In the second example McConkie cited Ps 2:7 This examination will include verse 8 Notice that it is the LORD Jehovah who says Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee I will declare the decree the LORD Jehovah hath said unto me Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession McConkie said these verses of Scripture are clearly Messianic and he acknowledged they teach that Christ would come as the Son of God What he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is Jehovah and that the sectarians who believe Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son is Jesus Christ the Only Begotten are right in their belief Another example involves Mic 5:4 Of this verse McConkie stated the following And so truly did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry Truly this is he of whom it is written_ He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth Mic 5:4 Promised Messiah p. 182 emphasis added According to McConkie the pronoun He at the beginning of Mic 5:4 refers to Christ during his mortal ministry Who then is the LORD his God Mic 5:4 reads And he Christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD Jehovah in the majesty of the name of the LORD Jehovah his God Elohim for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth Obviously the LORD of Jesus Christ is Jehovah the Father who is referred to as Jehovah his Elohim Another example involves Ps 2:2 and Isa 61:1 Of these verses McConkie stated the following A number of Messianic passages speak of the Lord and his anointed Ps 2:2 signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his _Jesus applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah 's prophecy The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek Isa 61:1 and then saying This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears Luke 4:21 Promised Messiah pp 182-183 emphasis added The first source McConkie quoted Ps 2:2 reads as follows The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD Jehovah and against his anointed McConkie said the anointed one was Christ If that is true who was Jehovah If Jehovah is always Christ who was the anointed one Obviously Jehovah is referring to God the Father and the anointed is indeed referring to Christ The second source McConkie cited is Isa 61:1 which states The Spirit of the Lord Adonai GOD Jehovah is upon me because the LORD Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound The one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open was Jesus Christ Who then was the one who anointed Him This verse says the LORD Jehovah did the anointing Again we face the same problem If Jehovah does not refer to the Father but only to Christ then Jesus anointed someone but who As McConkie pointed out Jesus applied these passages to himself Therefore the Jehovah who anointed Christ is God the Father Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not Jehovah However these should be enough to expose their error Now what about Mormonism 's claim that Jesus is Jehovah but He is not Elohim It is true that Jesus is Jehovah The following Scriptures prove this fact Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD Jehovah of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no God Isa 44:6 Jesus said I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead Rev 1:17-18 saith the LORD Jehovah they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son Zech 12:1,10 Behold he Christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him Rev 1:7 I am the LORD Jehovah thy God the Holy One of Israel Isa 43:3 Ye denied the Holy One Christ and the Just Acts 3:14 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD Jehovah shall be delivered Joel 2:32 the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Acts 4:10,12 Behold the Lord GOD Jehovah will come with strong hand his reward is with him Isa 40:10 Behold I Christ come quickly and my reward is with me Rev 22:12 the LORD Jehovah my God shall come and all the saints with thee Zech 14:5 at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints 1 Thess 3:13 The LORD Jehovah is my shepherd Ps 23:1 Jesus said I am the good shepherd John 10:14 saith the Lord GOD Jehovah I will seek that which was lost Ezek 34:15-16 the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost Luke 19:10 For I am the LORD Jehovah thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Saviour Isa 43:3 Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ Tit 2:13 See also Jer 42:5 and Rev 1:5 Mal 3:6 and Heb 13:8 1 Kin 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25 Isa 25:8 and 2 Tim 1:10 Ps 107:24,29 and Matt 8:26 Prov.3:12 and Rev 3:19 While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah they are wrong when they say He is not Elohim The Bible reveals that Jehovah is the only true Elohim there is all others are false Remember Jehovah is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Bible Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah and Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as Jehovah and Elohim but so is the Holy Spirit Whereof the _Holy Ghost_ _said_ This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more Heb 10:15-17 emphasis on Holy Ghost and said added Behold the days come _saith the LORD_ Jehovah that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God Elohim and they shall be my people I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more Jer 31:31,33-34 emphasis added For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_ 2 Pet 1:21 emphasis on Holy Ghost added The Spirit of the LORD Jehovah spake by me and his word was in my tongue 2 Sam 23:2 See also Heb 3:7-11 with Ps 95:6-11 Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah and Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons claim And when the LORD Jehovah saw that he Moses turned aside to see God Elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses And he said Here am I Bruce R. McConkie acknowledged that it was Christ 's voice that spoke to Moses in the burning bush Promised Messiah p. 394 And the LORD Jehovah said And Moses said unto God Elohim Behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them The God Elohim of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me What is his name what shall I say unto them And God Elohim said unto Moses I AM THAT I AM and he said Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I AM hath sent me unto you And God Elohim said moreover unto Moses Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the LORD Jehovah God Elohim of your fathers the God Elohim of Abraham the God Elohim of Isaac and the God Elohim of Jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations Exod 3:4,7,13-15 And God Elohim spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the LORD Jehovah Exod 6:2 I am the LORD Jehovah and there is none else there is no God Elohim beside me I girded thee though thou hast not known me Isa 45:5 But the LORD Jehovah is the true God Elohim he is the living God Elohim and an everlasting king Jer 10:10 Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD Jehovah of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no God Elohim Isa 44:6 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus saith the LORD Jehovah whose name is The God Elohim of hosts Amos 5:27 Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's Jehovah 's thy God Elohim the earth also with all that therein is Deut 10:14 Wherefore thou art great O LORD Jehovah God Elohim for there is none like thee neither is there any God Elohim beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears 2 Sam 7:22 And he said unto them I am an Hebrew and I fear the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land Jon 1:9 For who is God Elohim save the LORD Jehovah or who is a rock save our God Elohim Ps 18:31 Blessed is the nation whose God Elohim is the LORD Jehovah Ps 33:12 See also Ps 144:15 Hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting God Elohim the LORD Jehovah the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding Isa 40:28 The mighty God Elohim even the LORD Jehovah hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof Ps 50:1 Sing unto God Elohim sing praises to his name estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH and rejoice before him Ps 68:4 Regarding the word Jah Bruce R. McConkie stated Jah Hebrew Yah is a contracted form of Jehovah Jahveh or Yahweh all of which names have reference to Christ the God of Israel Mormon Doctrine p. 391 And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah to bring up from thence the ark of God Elohim whose name is called by the name of the LORD Jehovah of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims 2 Sam 6:2 the Great the Mighty God Elohim the LORD Jehovah of hosts is his name Jer 32:18 O my God Elohim make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind Fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name O LORD Jehovah That men may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH art the most high over all the earth Ps 83:13,16,18 The Bible clearly teaches that Jehovah is Elohim In fact He is the only Elohim there is He is the true the living the mighty the great and the everlasting Elohim He is the Elohim of Israel of all the kingdoms of the earth and of the heavens He is the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon Jehovah 's name is Elohim of hosts Amos 5:27 Not only is Jehovah Elohim but Elohim is Jehovah The Bible reveals that Elohim 's name is Jah Ps 68:4 Jehovah Ps 83:18 and Jehovah of hosts 2 Sam 6:2 Jer 32:18 The nation whose Elohim is Jehovah is blessed Ps 33:12 Clearly this is not the Jehovah and Elohim of the Mormons Another Mormon error regarding Elohim and Jehovah is the belief that Elohim not Jehovah is the Father of all the spirits including Jesus In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve apostles states that God the Eternal Father 'Elohim is the literal Parent of the spirits of the human race p. 466 This Doctrinal Exposition also states explicitly that Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth for He is one of them He is The Son as they are sons and daughters of Elohim p. 473 The Apostle Talmage stated that _Elohim_ is the name-title of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ Jesus the Christ p. 38 The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this matter Jehovah-Christ did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof _But when it came to placing man on earth there was a change in Creators_ That is the Father himself became personally involved All things were created by the Son using the power delegated by the Father except man _In the spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the Father_ There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned Promised Messiah p. 62 emphasis added Mormon leaders claim that Jehovah-Christ did not create either man 's spirit or his body They maintain that the Mormon Elohim who is the father created man both in spirit and body The Bible reveals the truth about who created man And Moses spake unto the LORD Jehovah saying Let the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of the _spirits of all flesh_ set a man over the congregation Num 27:15-16 See also 16:20-23 emphasis added the LORD Jehovah which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and _formeth the spirit of man within him_ Zech 12:1 emphasis added the LORD Jehovah made us this soul Jer 38:16 For I will not contend for ever neither will I be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the _souls which I have made_ saith the LORD Jehovah Isa 57:16,19 emphasis on souls I have made added Behold I am the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim _of all flesh_ Jer 32:27 emphasis added Thus saith the LORD Jehovah thy redeemer and he that _formed thee from the womb_ I am the LORD Jehovah that maketh all things Isa 44:24 emphasis added Thus saith the LORD Jehovah I have made the earth and _created man_ upon it Isa 45:11-12 emphasis added God Elohim created man upon the earth Unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the LORD Jehovah he is God Elohim there is none else beside him Deut 4:32,35 Thus saith God El the LORD Jehovah he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein Isa 42:5 Thus saith the LORD Jehovah of hosts the God Elohim of Israel I have made the earth _the man_ and the beast that are upon the ground Jer 27:4-5 most emphasis added The Bible reveals that it is Jehovah who is the Elohim of the spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself that it was He who formed the spirit of man within him that He made us this soul and formed us from the womb He did indeed create man If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah then they are wrong when they say he did not create man If they are right when they say the father is the one who created man then they are wrong when they say he is not Jehovah Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man Mormon scriptures teach that he did The BoM states the following Behold I am Jesus Christ I am the Father and the Son And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_ for never has man believed in me as thou hast Behold this body which ye now behold is the body of my spirit and _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit Eth 3:14-16 emphasis added For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is _I that hath created them_ Mos 26:23 emphasis added the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob is that same God who created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are Behold _he created Adam_ Mor 9:11-12 emphasis added D C 93:10 states that the worlds were made by him Christ _men were made by him_ all things were made by him and through him and of him emphasis added Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving Jehovah and his creation is the belief that Jehovah had many pre-mortal spirits helping him create Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith Jr. That he Christ was aided in the creation of this earth by many of the noble and great spirit children of the Father is evident from go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell Abra 3:22-24 Michael or Adam was one of these Enoch Noah Abraham Moses Peter James and John Joseph Smith and many other noble and great ones played a part in the great creative enterprise Doctrines of Salvation vol 1 pp 74-75 Mormon Doctrine p. 169 The Bible reveals the truth about this matter Thus saith the LORD Jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb I am the LORD Jehovah that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself Isa 44:24 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea Job 9:8 Jehovah by Himself created all things He had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim the Apostle McConkie stated Elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being God above all Gods Mormon Doctrine p. 224 He also stated that Jesus is above all save the Father only Promised Messiah p. 363 The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called gods is the triune God Jehovah For the LORD Jehovah is a great God El and a great King above all gods Elohim Ps 95:3 For thou LORD Jehovah art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods Elohim Ps 97:9 Now I know that the LORD Jehovah is greater than all gods Elohim Exod 18:11 See also Ps 135:5 Deut 10:17 If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jehovah is god the son and Elohim is god the father these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his father However as McConkie clearly stated Mormons believe Elohim the father not Jehovah the son is the God above all Gods that Jesus is above all except the father yet the Bible teaches that Jehovah is above all Elohim At a BYU Dev on March 2 1982 Bruce R. McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed This is plain sectarian nonsense Our prayers are addressed to the Father and to him only Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father in the name of the Son it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost Our Relationship With the Lord pp 19-20 McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons pray to the Father not the Son On p. 306 of the same book McConkie states that Christ the Son is Jehovah This is important to remember because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is Jehovah the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to Jehovah and He not only heard those prayers but He accepted them as valid requests The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to Jehovah In my distress I called upon the LORD Jehovah and cried unto my God Elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears Ps 18:6 And the LORD Jehovah said unto him I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually 1 Kin 9:3 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet Let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the LORD Jehovah thy God Elohim even for all this remnant Jer 42:2 O LORD Jehovah I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name Neh 1:11 And it was so that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD Jehovah he arose from before the altar of the LORD Jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven 1 Kin 8:54 He went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the LORD Jehovah 2 Kin 4:33 Go and say to Hezekiah Thus saith the LORD Jehovah the God Elohim of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will add unto thy days fifteen years Isa 38:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD Jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found Ps 32:5-6 Notice above in Ps 32:6 that the godly pray to Jehovah According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders that is Christ the very one to whom McConkie said people should not pray The Bible reveals there is only one true Elohim and His name is Jehovah All other Elohim are false They are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true Elohim and idolatry For the LORD Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods Elohim For all the gods Elohim of the nations are idols but the LORD Jehovah made the heavens Ps 96:4-5 Thou shalt have no other gods Elohim before me Exod 20:3 Now I know that the LORD Jehovah is greater than all gods Elohim Exod 18:11 And it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD Jehovah thy God Elohim and walk after other gods Elohim and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish Deut 8:19 Thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods Elohim They shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their gods Elohim it will surely be a snare unto thee Exod 23:32- 33 Take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods Elohim and worship them Deut 11:16 That ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods Elohim nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them Josh 23:7 neither walk after other gods Elohim to your hurt Jer 7:6 But the LORD Jehovah is the true God Elohim he is the living God Elohim Jer 10:10 And they forsook the LORD Jehovah God Elohim of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods Elohim of the gods Elohim of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the LORD Jehovah to anger Jud 2:12 Shall a man make gods Elohim unto himself and they are no gods Elohim Therefore behold I will this once cause them to know I will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the LORD Jehovah Jer 16:20-21 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD Jehovah choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods Elohim which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods Elohim of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the LORD Jehovah And the people answered and said God Elohim forbid that we should forsake the LORD Jehovah to serve other gods Elohim Josh 24:15-16 These verses teach that the only true living Elohim in heaven and on earth is Jehovah the triune God who made heaven and earth and all therein Jehovah is greater than any Elohim because all other Elohim are idols The reality behind them is demonic Deut 32:17 Jehovah Elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false Elohim He told His people not to have any Elohim but Him He told the people that if they left Him for the false Elohim those Elohim would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and would perish He warned the people to take heed that their heart be not deceived into worshiping serving swearing by and making covenants with false Elohim Jehovah Elohim told His people He would eventually judge all false Elohim and their followers Despite these warnings and guidelines Elohim 's covenant people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false Elohim 's of the people they came in contact with Ju 10:6 states that the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD Jehovah and served Baalim and Ashtaroth and the gods Elohim of Syria and the gods Elohim of Zidon and the gods Elohim of Moab and the gods Elohim of the children of Ammon and the gods Elohim of the Philistines and forsook the LORD Jehovah and served not him This examination has shown that the Elohim of Mormonism like the Elohim in Ju 10:6 is not the true Jehovah Elohim Therefore the people who leave the true Elohim for the Mormon Elohim will do evil in the sight of the LORD Jehovah Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father Jehovah sent His Son into the world these beliefs are true God is triune He is Spirit He is Jehovah and He did send His Son into the world to redeem mankind It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who thrash around in darkness about who Elohim and Jehovah are One wonders what Holy Writ McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that Elohim is the Father and that Jehovah is the Son He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are all the one Jehovah Elohim He apparently did not mean the D C either because chapter 109 verses 1,4,9-10 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as Jehovah Summary Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith 's statement that the Mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God Doctrines of Salvation 1:279 is not accurate The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and idolatry In answer to Jesus question But whom say ye that I am Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles preached Therefore anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in another Jesus whom Paul warned about Bernard P. Brockbank of the First Quorum of the Seventy admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign a Mormon publication that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus He stated that it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints p. 26 The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and idolatry They do not have the Son therefore they do not have the Father and they do not have eternal life As the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated Salvation comes only by worshiping the true God Promised Messiah p. 163 McConkie also rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God because the true names of Deity can be applied to false concepts of God Mormon Doctrine p. 270 Remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith Jr. gave a new conception of God and the Godhead Contributions of Joseph Smith p. 1 It is important for the people who have left the true triune God revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him They must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the LORD Jehovah the fountain of living waters Jer 17:13 And it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD Jehovah thy God Elohim and walk after other gods Elohim and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish Deut 8:19 Thou shalt make no covenant with their gods Elohim Exod 23:32 Put away the strange gods Elohim that are among you and be clean and change your garments Gen. 35:2 flee from idolatry 1 Cor 10:14 It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible If they do they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and idolatry Remember to know the only true God is eternal life John 17:3"

recreation,rec.autos,"Archive-name rec-autos/part5 this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers rpw changes as of 14 April 1993 revised brake fluid section as non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available rpw Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions Q What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean A Typically you will see something like 195/60HR14 the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower The 60 is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width Our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 195 117 mm The 14 is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called TRX' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like 390 which is in millimeters The R means Radial and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate Common speed ratings are S 112MPH T 118MPH H 130MPH and V up to 150MPH Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like 195/60R14 85H the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice What follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum per-tire loads Load Index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 Max Load Kg 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table In some cases the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size the LT designation indicates Light Truck and the P designation indicates Passenger car If no letter is given then the application of the tire is Passenger car usage As far as I know these letters only appear in the US market The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles For the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at all If the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably 80 but may be 78 Tires with an MS mud/snow designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h about 12mph There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear Temperature and Traction are graded A B and C with A the best and C the worst treadwear is a numeric rating These values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires Q My car has tires with a funny size designation 185/65HR390 can i put normal tires on the car A Your tires are called TRX tires they were devised by Michelin Because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed TRX type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to Michelin Avon makes suitable tires Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires Q Can I rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car A Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes Michelin and Goodyear others for example Pirelli and Nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturer 's recommendations Q How many snow tires should I buy and if I buy 2 which end of the car should I put them on A In short 4 and both ends To explain many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who do n't drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice With a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle In a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards Radar Detectors and Speed Limits Q Why are n't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits in this Q A posting A Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and rec.autos always start long tedious and pointless flame wars If you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there Safety Equipment Q Do airbags really work A Preliminary statistics suggest the following Airbags work much better than no belts good 3 point belts alone work much better than Airbags alone and AirBags 3 point belts work slightly better than 3 point belts alone The con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver 's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the driver 's hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult Brake Questions Q Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned Midas always wants to do this A No There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them Note also that some rotors the rotors on many Hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved Q They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down Is this really a good idea A It used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes In modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs Otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings On the other hand many standard driver 's license tests in the USA still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking I suggest that before taking a US driver 's test you either 1 learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or 2 borrow a car with an automatic to take the test Q How often should I replace my brake fluid A Probably more often than you do Traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid DOT-3 type are older fluids DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications The principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid DOT-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_ DOT-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior see the next Q A for more details While the requirements imply that DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids there may be specific cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications Otherwise DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel Replacement once a year is recommended for DOT-4 fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly Q What about DOT-5 brake fluids A This breaks down in to two parts The DOT-5 specification looks excellent for performance but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone based Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition Unlike DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids they do not absorb water at all While this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring The water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs Because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to Silicone fluids Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids 1 they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and 2 while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids SIlicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard that do not contain Silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids but I have little information at this time Q ABS is available on some of the cars I 'm looking at but it costs more Is it worth it A This does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons The short answer is that ABS costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case Now for the long answer ABS works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes It may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market It can not detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup The sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or OE-equivalent components When the sensors detect lockup the ABS system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the ABS will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_ then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles The percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an ABS system this is about 40 On dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform threshold braking nearly every time Unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only Audi of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this eventuality A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves steering control This is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the ABS will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied Braking distances will lengthen accordingly An important caution ABS can not exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice do n't expect an ABS system to help you out very much The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an ABS system in your car As far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions I 've listed above you have to worry about the following 1 parts costs are much higher the OE master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for 185 but the OE master cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for over 1000 Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5 silicone brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles Because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular I suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important Q What about this threshold braking business A normally I 'd not put this in the consumers Q A but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is needed here rpw Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock 'em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered Basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely Drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal In many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it In any case if you ca n't hear the tires whine just a bit you're not very near the threshold In a car with ABS often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and they 'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS take over Recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with ABS systems The police departments in question quickly blamed the new ABS systems but according to Autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system If you think about it for a minute you 'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2 so if you cut the 40 duty cycle of an ABS system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient Gas Questions Q Does High Octane gasoline help A Maybe maybe not Some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used On most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well Check your owner 's manual for details on what your car needs Q My car was made for leaded gasoline Will unleaded gas hurt it A It is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise The actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead You should however check your owner 's manual many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline Q Do fuel treatments help What kind should I use A Some do and some do n't During the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems Never use an additive containing Methanol sometimes called Methyl Alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection Manufacturer 's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owner's manual on your car before using these Most manufacturers consider 10 Ethanol acceptable in gasoline Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol Isopropanol and Petroleum Distillates are fine in fuel injected cars An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol or Methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank There are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones but work much much better Among these are Chevron Techron Redline SL-1 Wurth Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber and BG 44K A bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended Q What about detergent gasolines A The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat BMW has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact Stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations If such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits Lubrication Questions Q What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean A There are several different items encoded There is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like SE SF CD or such The S codes are for gasoline engine applications the C codes are for diesel engine applications The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus SF is considered better than SE SE is considered better than SD and so forth The more noticeable designation is the oil weight This is either a single number e.g. 30 weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter W e.g. 10W30 The latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals The first number in the designation 10W is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the W stands for winter The second number 30 is the viscosity of the oil when hot There is a trick here the oil does n't actually get thicker turn from 10 weight to 30 weight as it gets hotter What is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil as it gets hotter it does n't get thin as fast as a 10W oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all 30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot Note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX 10W40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time 10W30 15W40 and 20W50 oils work very well though Q Are quick lube places any good A Some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there Let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they do n't overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times Q Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good A Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives Many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 50 's PTFE is the chemical name for Teflon TM a trademark owned by DuPont In general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products Most USENET responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of MPG after application smoother revving but long term results whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles are debatable Some manufacturers such as Saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage Some BMW owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of Slick 50 to their cars This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50 Dealer that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine Otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives On the other hand there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world Q Do synthetic oils really work A Yes but More specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car Even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely Amsoil Redline and AGIP are very highly regarded and very effective Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however Q Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals How often should I change my oil A It depends on how you drive If your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you do n't drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturer 's recommendation is probably fine If however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it does n't get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at 3000 mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying 7500 mile intervals If you do n't drive your car much at all say 7500 miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway If you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage Misc Questions Q My car has a timing belt I hear that bad things happen when they break What 's the story A It depends on the internal design of the motor Early Ford Escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt Some Honda motors will not be damaged but others will be If no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles some cars may require more frequent replacement Ask your dealer or independent mechanic Also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake Q Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks A For performance reasons Compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles Q What causes Unintended Acceleration A The final report of the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause"

computer,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,Well I 'm amazed at how successful this exercise was I received 20 responses and 4 requests for summary Thanks to everyone who made it possible On my own I was able to find out about Codebase Accsys and Q+E Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without SQL Q+E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls where you send a SQL string and receive the results Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland Other products mentioned were Microsoft 's ODBC Accsys Quadbase Codebase RBASE and Q+E Only ODBC Quadbase RBASE and Q+E have SQL For myself I decided on Codebase mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS UNIX etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application It works with DBASE FoxPro or Clipper files However I feel that Microsoft 's ODBC looks very promising It 's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries and formatting query results As the responses say it 's available via ftp except it 's effectively unusuable without two manuals the ODBC Programmer 's Reference and the ODBC SDK Guide Moreover ODBC does n't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases that 's up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers Also it 's Windows only it 's actually an extension to the Windows SDK Nevertheless it 's a start at a SQL interface standard and should make life interesting in the future Here 's my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want The current version is 3.0 which is fully compatible with ack Paradox 4.0 Why the versions are different I do n't know PD Engine 2.0 was compatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5 It consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal I think turbo Pascal 5.5 and up and C I think either Microsoft or Borland Now reading the box it 's Borland Paradox Engine Database Frameworks Works with any Borland Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later Turbo for Windows Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later TP for Windows 1.0 or later For Framework applications 3.0 or later or MS 7.0 It does have support for object useage I have n't had a real chance to really use it myself but it looks fairly complete I 'm planning to use it this

help you From David Lefebvre david hp817.speedware.com Borland provides a database lib called Paradox Engine which can access and use the database files aswell as many other things Gary bell nellads.cc.monash.edu.au Paradox Engine is the library for Paradox Artur Babecki artur ii.uj.edu.pl Borland sells the Paradox Engine which has all the Paradox calls in it Its hardly SQL though You can do searches on key fields and on indivual fields but no comparison operators like so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and inserts/updates I 'm currently using it I have an eval copy and I 've linked it in to some entry screens I 've written The Engine library adds about 100K to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using Borland 's VROOM manager Now Borland claims that later versions of the engine will have SQL support but they do n't really expect it till late in the year or even next year They are trying to get thrid parties to help out If you have any other questions let me know Mike Kamlet mike vpnet.chi.il.us Yes borland sells their Paradox Engine separately It has C and Pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in C Well at least for version 2.0 of the Engine which I have costed 99 at Egghead They now have version 3.0 of the engine and a separate class package for it Michael D.

religion,soc.religion.christian,Desiree Bradley Desiree_Bradley mindlink.bc.ca asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing God 's work in Bosnia I've refrained from posting in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer But at this point I feel I have to say something Many things about this posting bother me I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel Christ died to break down these distinctions In him there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female If Moslems do not know him we may preach to them but we do n't kill them Furthermore the attack is between states not religions There are Christians being attacked as well One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully The precedents being suggested are from the OT There are in fact two different things being alluded to The first is from the entry into Canaan For that to be a parallel we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet And we would need the war to be a holy war There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated Rape would not have been tolerated While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites and that once that was done even when deception was involved they were expected to honor it In contrast there have been many violations of agreement in this incident I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land and if he had their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war The other OT parallel is from later when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins Someone asks whether we should n't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we should n't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God 's judgement Yes even bad things may be used by God for good That includes actions of bad people But that doesn't justify them If you read the prophets you find them very clear that in attacking Israel the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as unintentional agents of God Their intent was to attack God's people and they would be judged for it The fact that they were actually carrying out God 's plan did n't excuse their action Furthermore we should n't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God God explicitly interpreted that case through his prophets As far as I know he did not send any prophets to Bosnia While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad But that does n't justify it and it wo n't save the people who are doing it from judgement

Heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally if at all concerned with the metaphysical substance of man 's being and nature A good introductory book in fact one of the best introductory books to Islam in general is Murtaza Mutahhari 's Fundamental's of Islamic Thought God Man and the Universe Mizan Press translated by R. Campbell Truly a beautiful book A follow-up book if you can find a decent translation is Wilaya The Station of the Master by the same author I think it also goes under the title of Master and Mastership It 's a very small book really just a transcription of a lecture by the author The introduction to the beautiful Psalms of Islam translated by William C.

religion,soc.religion.christian,speaking of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Yes For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers consider You alone and your Mother are more beautiful than any others For there is no blemish in you nor any stains upon your Mother Who of my children can compare in beauty to these St. Ephrem the Syrian Nisibene Hymns 27:8 around A.D. 370 Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary a Virgin not only undefiled but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate free of every stain of sin St. Ambrose Commentary on Psalm 118 22:30 ca A.D. 388 There are many others No We have for instance Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of Holy Mary and being questioned did not immediately add the Virgin And to Holy Mary Virgin is invariably added for that Holy Woman remains undefiled St. Epiphanus of Salamis Panacea against all heresies between A.D. 374-377 We surely can not deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine about children of Mary For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord home of the Eternal King with the seed of human intercourse Anyone who proposes this is merely proposing that Christ could not be born of a virgin Pope St. Siricius Letter to Anysius Bishop of Thessalonica A.D. 392 Note that St. Augustine 's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387 I do n't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was but I 'm quite sure it was after 392 The belief in Mary 's perpetual virginity originated long before Augustine 's time We hold that it originated with the Apostles Strictly speaking however Mary 's perpetual virginity is independent of her Immaculate Conception Mary could have been Immaculately Conceived and not remained a virgin she could have remained a virgin and not been Immaculately Conceived No It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception when a person 's life begins Biology had nothing to do with it Prayerfully reflecting on the truth of Mary 's sinlessness and the means by which God could have achieved this the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate Conception Thus the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was given by Pope Sixtus IV 1471-84 and the Feast was made a precept feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI 1700-21 No First of all Lourdes is private revelation and doctrine is not based on private revelation The most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle Second the case for the doctrine was irreformably sealed in 1854 with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull Ineffabilis Deus by Pope Pius IX This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma a dogma by definition can not change and is required to be believed by the faithful The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858 four years later The most that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval but the Church has never claimed that nor shall she In Christ 's Peace Brad Kaiser bradk isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com

religion,alt.atheism,I read it when it first came out and the controversy broke Put my name on the waiting list at the library that way if the book was really offensive none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher and read it cover to cover to use a phrase that seems popular here right now And I liked it The writing style was a little hard to get used to but it was well worth the effort Coming from a similar background Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family and moved to England I grew up in New Delhi it made a strong impression on me And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English the yaar at the end of a sentence Butbutbut the occasional hindi phrase etc At the time I still sorta-kinda thought of myself as a muslim and I could n't see what the flap was all about It seemed clear to me that this was allegory It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed 's wives and had not as my grandfather thundered implied that Muhammed 's wives were prostitutes in short every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely And I wo n't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book Oops I just did Perhaps in a deep sense the book is insulting to Islam because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion why does an omnipotent deity need an agent She can come directly to me ca n't she How do we know that Muhammed did n't just go out into the desert and smoke something And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to did n't screw up or put in their own little verses And why can Muhammed marry more than four women when no other muslim is allowed to Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book sight unseen on the say-so of some holy guy Not to mention murder the author I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book A really silly argument after all how many of these same people have read Mein Kampf It just made me wonder what are they afraid of Why do n't they just read the book and decide for themselves Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book and the absence of protest from the liberal muslims to Khomeini 's fatwa outrage was the final push I needed into atheism -s

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,Hi I need some advice opinions regarding which PC would best suit my needs I want to use this proposed beast for basically four things Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 under dos Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 under dos Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under Windows 3.1 these images can be large say 2k x 2k 24bits/pixel Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS talking to our network of Sparcstation 's this is where a lot of the images/data come from and is the most demanding of these tasks I 've read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup and decided that a nice system price/performance would be 486DX-50 256k cache ISA VLB 16meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 2 meg ram local bus 15 monitor 1280x1024 NI 3Com Etherlink III 16bit Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However the parts do n't fit Our local retailer apparently put one of these together only to discover that the ATI card would n't run at 50MHz surprise surprise Actually after reading this group I 'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB or a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card Which is better keeping in mind that I 'm primarily interested in the last two tasks Any help would be greatly appreciated I need to decide quickly so any speedy help would be appreciated even more BTW We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following configuration 486DX-33 64k cache ISA 8 meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra+ 2 meg ram 14 monitor 1024x768 NI SMC Ethercard 8 bit Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We 're quite happy with the ATI card very fast ONCE the data gets to it ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or been uncovered There does n't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X Its sluggish running the local window manager Also many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time even when the images fit entirely in ram There 's not enough memory in the system DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive do n't leave much room for other apps Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec still very slow especially when moving large images Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming Will it make a difference I 'm hoping so and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice above for that reason Also are there DX2-100 's on the horizon What about DX3-99 's DX3-150 's Any information is greatly appreciated

religion,soc.religion.christian,The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God Romans 13 And furthermore God foreknows everything that would happen It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds the inevitablity of the sucess of God 's plan and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil However though they are doing evil and we should not cooperate with them when they do such it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible In short the slaughter in Bosnia though deplorable in the eyes of God maybe then again they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins Onan in the Old Testmament for example and Annias and Spahira in the New is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished But do n't forget it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of Let his blood be upon our hands of the crowd in Jersualem And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon which got Israel which was inturn gotten by Persia etc God does use nations to punish other nations as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament Do n't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel Mene mene tekel peres Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice found severly wanting and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites ordered by God as the task of Israel The Cannanites had been given their chance found severly wanting and the Great Judge carried out His just sentence accrodingly I could go on with more examples but I see little need to do so as my point is quite clear Two things need to be remembered at all times 1 It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has In His divine Wisdom He made the world as was best in His eyes and like Paul says in Romans 9 the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter 2 The message of Jesus Christ is as follows Repent now for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying Let the dead bury the dead come follow me There is not an infinite amount of time rather Christ is passing by right now calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men He does not say well alright you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans He said Follow me His message is NOT I 'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly you 've got all the time in the world and Divine Judgement that 's only a fairy tale Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ Titus 2.5 is also the just and righteous Judge of the world And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy

recreation,rec.sport.hockey,21 PETER AHOLA Season 2nd Acquired '92-93 trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations Grade I B It is way too early to tell about Ahola who was acquired probably because the Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft Ahola had only played 50 games this season I think it 's actually less the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here 20 of them with the Sharks In the games he has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he has n't been spectacular and his offense is n't anything to write home about 8 points it 's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be Peter Ahola 24 DOUG WILSON Season 16th Acquired '91-92 trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and 2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade I B I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson I may have had too high expectations for him but his legs knees et al. are giving out Nevertheless when he was playing he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities even if he has lost a step on defense which unfortunately he demonstrated this year as well as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team 20 points in 42 games But next year which may be Wilson 's last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor 29 DEAN KOLSTAD Season 2nd Acquired '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade I It 's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games forgetting exact number but no more than 15 but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL In those games he did not impress anyone after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks and was even less impressive defensively as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team 38 PAT MACLEOD Season 2nd Acquired '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade I MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad because the Sharks were reluctant to use him but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors figuring that he would n't clear waivers in fact he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs Since he has played so little I ca n't even give a tentative grade on him but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills 41 TOM PEDERSON Season 1st Acquired '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade I B+ Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net including yours truly He demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring 20 points in 43 games However his size 5 9 165 lbs is of concern and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically on both sides of the ice although he had appeared fearless in his approach But to be successful he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league 45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN Season 1st Acquired '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade I He played all of ~5 games in the league this year but was thoroughly umimpressive just as he was at the end of last season again it may be a small sample but just as in the case of Kolstad Scremin at age 25 is quickly running out of time He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin 's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre

politics,talk.politics.misc,If you happen to know a political position which does not have people advocating it who do more harm than good please point it out One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S. Constitution In fact the fillibuster we 're talking about isn't in the Constitution I objected to your suggestion that the Senate was n't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given I 'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time Bush never had any real support in Congress The real point is that everybody everywhere got their pork from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he 'd bought with food stamps He spent more in food stamps on junk than I make in a week and I 'm not on government assitance Lessee let 's pull out the old Almanac In 1980 total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars In 1992 est they were 1.4754 trillion dollars an increase of approx 884 billion dollars In 1980 National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars In 192 it was 307 billion dollars and increase of 174 billion dollars That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for This represented an increase of 230 In 1980 Income Security which includes retirement programs Housing Assitance and unemployment benefits and I believe welfare cost 86.5 billion dollars In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars or more than national defense started This represented an increase of 230 In 1980 the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars an increase of 368 In 1980 the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like In 1992 it was 87 billion In 1980 Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars In 1992 it was 94 billion dollars Agriculture up 9 billion to 17 billion Science up 11 billion to 16 billion Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion Education up 14 billion to 45 billion Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category primarily under Supply and Community Development in the area of disaster relief and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars Where was this huge diversion Not that 's a stretch If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess would n't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue I see very little positive about it The Constitution was designed to frustrate the democratic process so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened Nor do I see putting the brakes on the democratic process an inherently bad thing Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse Sometimes or perhaps most of the time the people should be told no and pointed to their local government Phill would you do me the very great favor of repeating that in talk.politics.guns Cute We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating the law Free speech alone is dangerous Phill OK Phill All you got ta show me is a clear pattern of reduction in homicide rates across several countries and that'll be it Not current mind you reduction Who 's chaining anything to freedom of speech By calling it a freedom Phill you 're a master of subtly changing the subject I haven't based my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution I've tried to explain why it is n't a good idea The only time I 've referred to the Constitution is to point out it does n't contain the restrictions on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were meant but just did n't make it in there The Constitution does n't contain the 41 fillibuster rule I only believe that the rule is a good idea You c n't dismiss that as venerating the Constitution because it is n't in the Constitution

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,We have no way of knowing because we can not separate Morris contribu- tion from the rest of the team 's There is only one way of determin- ing best in baseball And that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game Each game determines which team is the best that day At the end of the season the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division The playoffs determine the best of the best But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re- lates to the teams Not the individual players There is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances And that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely that player A 's team would have played better with player B in their lineup Sheer speculation Impossible to ascertain If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria then fine But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual 's contribution to winning the WS because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base- ball So until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of Clemens is totally sub- jective and is mere opinion I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon Exactly The Jays won with Morris pitching And Boston wins with Clemens pitching I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens I am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about You do n't have to be rude For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy Ignoratio Elenchi I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings although I have tongue in cheek claimed that in the past I am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual 's performance from that of his team 's for the purpose of comparing that individual 's performance with another individual 's per- formance The stats are a nice hobby and that 's about it There is no new knowledge being produced So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds

politics,talk.politics.misc,Since our doctors are private and the system is just an insurance plan litigation would not involve the insurance fund Our lawyers do not work on contingency so that if you were to sue for malpractice then you 'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees likewise if you were a doctor and subject of a suit it 's time to sweat A few weeks ago the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to the NYT to decry a lobbyist 's advert repeating the same old trash This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked organizations and he would not have done it without the approval of his AMA cronies It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital since not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff that others do n't Ottawa 's population is only a quarter million if you include the surrounding counties People of influence will get their way in any system American or European It 's the Golden Rule he who has the gold makes the rules As for annual budgets those are actually annual grants for facilities e.g. mops pans etc given to hospitals of which most are private nonprofit foundations btw I have no problem with having aggressive for-profit hospitals like the French who use our approach but in the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so their market is much more diverse The rest has to be made up for by billings from patients who use their services The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay and are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield the 13-14 figure for the U.S. How They are collecting premiums and I 'm an advocate of having copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look more like the real insurance that it is The private doctors and hospitals will still be there after the insurance hypothically disappears as they were there before it appeared For one thing I think that Bob Rae is an idiot Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are a player he wants to spend our money on other things than the health insurance Our high taxes are high for other spending but health insurance which is separate and optional and it is being spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party OHIP is just a health insurance plan it does not provide any kind of health care that is up to you and your private doctors Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of American companies and their parents provide full insurance down here Regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in basic coverage The private firms are making too much money after having gotten rid of basic coverage They run around patting them- selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras for those people who deserve it I agree they were in a win-win situation But right now it seems that they have won bigger when you look at how full their coffers are Friends from my sisters MBA class were still being flown out for job interviews individually with insurance firms in London ON Canada 's insurance capitol a la Hartford along with generous expense privileges this year despite the ongoing post-recession blues gld

science,sci.med,But why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy Well I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word also extra-scientific etc. Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality In terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etc The same may be said about logical grounds My point is that quite frequently perhaps even most frequently the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli 's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of air hypothesis Was this theory and the resulting experimental test surprising Well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so Was the theory constructed and the experiment designed out of perfectly rational grounds Well there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a novelty at the time Was the theory interesting Yes Was it new Well one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain but I think this begs certain questions We can debate that if you like

I used to have a '67 Galaxie convertible was sitting at a light waiting for it to turn green It turned green but I hesitated a little sleeping I guess and a bird bombed me it landed directly in front of me at eye level I guess the bird miscalculated and thought I was going to take off right away And I 'm still trying to figure out the one I got under my rear bumper as well Was the bird flying up and doing fancy acrobatics at my car and decided to drop one while executing a perfect loop TT030 Mustang GT |George Kirkaldie |Pioneer Audio Control |gkirkaldie sanity.tdkcs.waterloo.on.ca |Phoenix Gold Kicker |Flowmaster Motorsport |Cambridge Ontario Canada A T A R I

science,sci.med,I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog 's Frosted Flakes She is perfectly healthy had never experienced anything like this before and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family All the tests EEG MRI EKG came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again Well we were going along fine and the other morning April 5 she had a bowl of another Kellog 's frosted kind of cereal Fruit Loops I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while So I pour it in her bowl and think Oh oh this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea Now after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even he is scratching his head Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure Once again we are waiting I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being Anyway as you can guess I am worried sick about this and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here Thanks

religion,alt.atheism,I hope there is not one- with a subject like this you just have a spiral What would then be a morality of a morality of morals Labels do n't make arguments One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be interpreted even though this would hardly seem moral For example The best thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough Hence all actions must be weighed against this one statement whatever helps this goal is moral whatever does not is immoral Of course this leads such a blank space there are so many different ways to fulfill a goal one would need a hyper-morality to apply to just the methods Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think about it long enough On the other hand maybe it is our first gut reaction Which Who knows perhaps here we have a way to discriminate morals I do n't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right the same way I instinctively feel torture is wrong but if I thought about it long enough and listened to the arguments I could perhaps reason that it was wrong is that possible See the difference best regards Adam
computer,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,I am using DOS Quick C 2.5 in a DOS window under Windows 3.1 and the other day while I was running the compiler I got a general protection fault immediately followed by a serious disk error When I rebooted I found that about 15 files had gotten cross-linked which is a pretty serious corruption of the hard drive file system I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained by Windows If that is true then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing to do with it Has anybody else had this type of problem I only recently upgraded from Quick C 2.0 to 2.5 Brad Banko

religion,talk.religion.misc,God being unknowable I ca n't comment on His motives but it would be distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of our own For sanity 's sake we must assume if we believe in Him at all that His message comes through somehow The question is whether it comes through immediately to every individual or is contained in a complex canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret extend and modify the canon If God 's message is indeed mediated the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly Since the responsibility for understanding lies ultimately with the individual we must assume that God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source for that individual whereof the person may or may not drink Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness You might have said burp for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today If you are talking about taking the Lord 's name in vain as a serious transgression then this example is more a case of hypocrisy than of varying moral codes If there is an absolute moral code propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally by definition Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code as you say at the outset So for example God 's code could include Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on but this law would be inapplicable to us Nevertheless we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God 's moral code you have a sense of the absurdity of the question Does God make laws for Himself to follow Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category morality can be sensibly applied

science,sci.electronics,"Firstly I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current Their performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap The other point is that big electro 's are usually rated with -5 +20 tolerances so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering the cold You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain that rolls over from zero to maximum count or vice-versa once every 1,209,600 seconds If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock you would need a divider chain of 2^27 to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period Of course you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit Caveat I 'm not experienced in low temperature electronics so I can't guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable conditions JohnH Electronics Department School of MPCE Macquarie University Sydney AUSTRALIA 2109 Email johnh mpce.mq.edu.au Ph +61 2 805 8959 Fax +61 2 805 8983"

science,sci.space,The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include Long transfer times radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both the spacecraft and OTV Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source messy dangerous and source of radiation damage or BIG solar arrays sensitive to radiation or heavy that make attitude control and docking a big pain If you go solar you have to replace the arrays every trip with current technology Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty Refueling even for very high Isp like xenon is still required and turn out to be a pain You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or and refueling You still ca n't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though I suppose they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problems get solved Not impossible in principle but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets at least today Just a few random thoughts on high Isp OTV 's I designed one once
recreation,rec.autos,They light the highways in Texas Funny everywhere else I 've been they only light 'em at junctions I wo n't even get into how much road markings vary between states and localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are essentially nonexistant I suspect you have very limited experience US freeways vary dramatically particularly between states I can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be very optimistic in any car I 'm not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be considered so They 're hard to take at 85mph That 's not the only interstate I 've seen with such deviations but it 's one I drive frequently Texas is pretty much an edge-case you ca n't assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such wide-open spaces It just ai n't so

science,sci.med,Following a series of miscarriages my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a foreign body Where this blocking is deficient the body evicts the intruder resulting in a miscarriage The white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability Following the transfusion she carried the next pregnancy to term and Jake is now an active 9 month-old who can not wait to walk We 're now thinking about having another child but no one including the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this Thanks Gene and Jane and Jake

recreation,rec.autos,re extended Ka bands I recently bought a 2 band detector You guys must all think I'm nuts right Well I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states Here 's how I found out A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders does n't even know what Ka is He 's heard of K which is what they use here and I explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc He then said yeah Ka stands for K automatic duuhh He then went on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned but he did n't know too much My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps even the real sneaky ones When I called the Escort Shop they confirmed that Ka is not used here or in surrounding states They did claim that Laser was being used a lot here which I was quite skeptical of So in the end instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting months for a state of the art detector I got a low priced high performance 2 band Escort 2200 Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately but I 've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good which was good enough for me and my wallet

religion,alt.atheism,Regardless of people 's hidden motivations the stated reasons for many wars include religion Of course you can always claim that the REAL reason was economics politics ethnic strife or whatever But the fact remains that the justification for many wars has been to conquer the heathens If you want to say for instance that economics was the chief cause of the Crusades you could certainly make that point But someone could come along and demonstrate that it was REALLY something else in the same manner you show that it was REALLY not religion You could in this manner eliminate all possible causes for the Crusades Scott I do n't have to make outrageous claims about religion 's affecting and effecting history for the purpsoe of a.a all I have to do point out that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate atheism At no time have I made any statement that religion was the sole cause of anything what I have done is point out that those who do make that kind of claim are mistaken usually deliberately To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to misunderstand human nature the function of religion and of course history I believe that those who distort history in this way know exaclty what they 're doing and do it only for affect

religion,alt.atheism,That 's fascinating I take it that you 're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent You could be right but it sounds plausible to me Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand Here 's some more Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding fathers but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany Plan of Union and later the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution That this would be absent from our school texts and from history and from media is not surprising given the devotion Americans feel to our founding myth Great men gathered to express a new vision that has withstood the test of time If it were revealed that Indians had a role in it imagine the blow to the American psyche By 1754 when most of these men and others gathered to creat the Albany Plan of Union the first try at confederation they invited forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors on confederate structures Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at Albany Congress It would be a strange thing if six nations of ignorant savages sic should be capable of forming such a union and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted for ages and appears indissoluble and yet that a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies According to Grinde Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde Jr. of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation_ addresses this issue

politics,talk.politics.mideast,This is such Bullshit Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the Jews and a massacre defines it best in my opinion The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the Jews a peace pact but the Irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians I might grant that this village housed armed Arabs I doubt it but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun The Deir Yassin MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland. and contrary to your belief many civilians were killed Deir Yassin was later advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many Palestinians to leave The Palestinians were rightfully scared off because they did not want another Deir Yassin I 'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east Both Arab and Jew suck equally

computer,comp.graphics,I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system Well I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons For example in the letter O there are two outlines 1 The outside outline which is clockwise TrueType font 2 The inside outline which is counterclockwise One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest This is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges I do not want to use this simplistic system since 1 It will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts 2 It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer My question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons Another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I ca n't tell which method is the best to implement Thanks for any pointers Rob Lansdale

science,sci.med,Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he started going to day care He was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month Most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics 3 weeks out of 4 I know kids in day care fall sick more often but we are beginning to wonder how often more often really is whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average what the longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are and what we can do to build up his resistance He really enjoys his day care and we think it 's great too but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions How often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick How often do they get colds flus ear infections Is there any data on home care vs. day care Does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it not have any long term effect Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal and what does one do about it Is there any way to build immunity and resistance Any data information or advice relating to this would be much appreciated Thanks a lot

politics,talk.politics.guns,"From Preston K. Covey covey+ andrew.cmu.edu Subject Gun Stats Mortal Risks Date Mon 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 EST Folks Hail from the nether world On February 4th the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled Armed Force I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect I sent the following to the WSJ Gun Stats Mortal Risks Preston K. Covey Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley ~Armed Force 2/4/93 WSJ cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County Washington found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to Given the shock value of the finding the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine NEJM study is remarkably understated ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home But what we need to know is this What exactly are the risks and benefits The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks Further as with motor vehicles we want to know What control do we have over the risks and benefits And as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents How can we minimize the risks Like raw highway death tolls the NEJM stat is not very helpful here The NEJM finding purports to inform us but it is framed to warn us off It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify The frightful statistic screams for itself The risks far outweigh the benefits yes What fool would run these risks If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you a loved one a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination should you not take the bus Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies Surely we can do better where lives are at stake Let~s take a closer look at this risky business The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense the divisor into the number of family members or acquaintances killed by a gun in the home the dividend The divisor of this risk equation is 9 in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense The dividend is 387 in the study there were 12 accidental deaths 42 criminal homicides and 333 suicides 387 divided by 9 yields 43 There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983 so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts 1 The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media the ~or acquaintances~ of the study who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members is equated to The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members dear friends and innocent children Deaths may all be equally tragic but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors This is criminological hogwash 2 The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent criminal or substance-abuse histories where the risk of death is very high versus households inhabited by more civil folk for example people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing gang banging and wife beating where the risk is very low indeed In actuality negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths by tautology neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk 3 One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect and this obscures indeed disregards the role of personal responsibility The typical quotation of this study unlike Larson~s attributes fatal agency to the gun ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic uses this particular formulation We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing again by tautology gun deaths would not occur without the guns The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway without the guns In any case people are the death-dealing agents the guns are their lethal instruments The moral core of the personal risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents human choice mediates homicide and suicide by gun or otherwise The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool The gun does not create this risk by itself People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes For example graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities Fortunately nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter 4 Suicide accounts for 84 of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study As against the total deaths by gun in King County including those outside the home in-house suicides are 44 of the total death toll which is closer to the roughly 50 proportion found by other studies Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides This is widely assumed or alleged but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases See Bruce L. Danto et al. The Human Side of Homicide Columbia University Press 1982 Charles Rich et al. ~Guns and Suicide American Journal of Psychiatry March 1990 If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation like the causes durability or interdiction of suicidal intent itself is a profoundly debatable matter Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue 5 Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide Most measures like the NEJM homicide rate are based on the immediate disposition of cases But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense In the literature on battered women immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide Time~s January 18 1993 cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40 of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out Time~s July 17 1989 cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51 of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims but only 3 of the homicides were reported as self-defense In a May 14 1990 update Time reported that 12 of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense In Time~s sample the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic 6 While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated the divisor is unconscionably misleading The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed not aggressors who are thwarted without being killed or even shot at The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled apprehended or deterred Should we not celebrate let alone count those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense notably by criminologist Gary Kleck Point Blank Guns and Violence in America Aldine de Gruyter 1992 Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies the rate is high about one million a year and the risk is good gun defenders fare better than anyone either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths from self-defense homicides suicides and accidents yields 33 Thus we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody Of course Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use as I have questioned the NEJM statistic Clearly the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics One thing troubles me still we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned even critically"

politics,talk.politics.guns,No The issue is reducing crime not guns If gun control doesn't lower crime overall then is does n't address the issue Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun and rarely shoot their victim A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him So while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife as opposed to threatening the victim with it It is n't at all clear that replacing the criminal 's gun with a knife would reduce murders Stabbings might just become more common That 's why it is important to look at the overall not the with-gun homicide rate It avoids the issue of substitution different criminal techinques of using different weapons etc and measures what we want to prevent Murders Face Possibly However facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic Very few criminals shoot from cover It attracts to much attention and they do n't have a chance to go through your pockets Overall I 'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife Actually the exact same statement is true of guns Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem You also ignore the criminal 's reaction The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals unarmed armed with a knife gun or whatever are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation If faced with a serious threat almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target Therefore using or threatening to use as is much more commonly the case a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker regardless of how he is armed Knives however are much less effective than guns Criminals do n't consider knifes as a serious threat nearly as often as they do guns

politics,talk.politics.misc,"THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release April 23 1993 PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT The East Room 1:00 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT Terry do you have a question Q Mr. President there 's a growing feeling that the Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something anything to stop the fighting Is the United States considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery sites THE PRESIDENT Well first let me say as you know for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action And I want to say too let 's look at the last three months Since I became President I have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward first on the no-fly zone on enforcement of it on the humanitarian airdrops on the war crimes investigation on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace process We have made some progress And now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution And Leon Fuerth who is the National Security Advisor to the Vice President is in Europe now working on implementing that That is going to make a big difference to Serbia And we are reviewing other options I think we should act We should lead the United States should lead We have led for the last three months We have moved the coalition And to be fair our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part And they have troops on the ground there But I do not think we should act alone unilaterally nor do I think we will have to And in the next several days I think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time as well as the time of the administration as it should have over the last 10 days or so I think we 'll finish that in the near future and then we 'll have a policy and we 'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it Q Can I follow up THE PRESIDENT Sure Q Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust THE PRESIDENT I think the Holocaust is on a whole different level I think it is without precedent or peer in human history On the other hand ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree The idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing And it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together And I think you have to stand up against it I think it 's wrong We were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning and I think we 're making progress on that front But what 's going on with the Serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of the region Q Mr. President by any count you have not had a good week in your presidency The tragedy in Waco the defeat of your stimulus bill the standoff in Bosnia What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently How do you look at things Are you reassessing Laughter THE PRESIDENT I do n't really believe that the situation in Bosnia it 's not been a good week for the world but I do n't know that the administration could have made it different On the stimulus package I 'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an American government We have abandoned trickle-down economics We 've abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from 1 trillion to 4 trillion in only a decade The budget plan which passed the Congress which will reduce the deficit and increase investment has led to a 20-year low in mortgage rates dramatically lower interest rates There are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months or who have had access to cheaper credit That 's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very very good for the country And so we are moving in the right direction economically I regret that the stimulus did not pass and I have begun to ask and will continue to ask not only people in the administration but people in the Congress whether there is something I could have done differently to pass that Part of the reason it did n't pass was politics part of it was a difference in ideas There are really people still who believe that it 's not needed I just disagree with that I think the recovery the economists say it 's been underway for about two years and we 've still had 16 months of seven- percent unemployment and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs So I think there was an idea base an argument there that while we 're waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward Now I have to tell you I did misgauge that because a majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983 and voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this I just misgauged it And I hope that I can learn something I 've just been here 90 days And you know I was a Governor working with a contentious legislature for 12 years and it took me a decade to get political reform there So it takes time to change things But I basically feel very good about what 's happened in the first 100 days with regard to the Congress Q Waco THE PRESIDENT Well with regard to Waco I do n't have much to add to what I 've already said I think it is a I want the situation looked into I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that I think it 's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over But I still maintain what I said from the beginning that the offender there was David Koresh And I do not think the United States government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves And I 'm sorry that they killed their children Q Mr. President to follow up partly on Helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill Ross Perot said today that you 're playing games with the American people in your tax policy He was strongly critical of your stimulus package He said he 's going to launch an advertising campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement How are you going to handle his political criticism Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan And do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the Hill THE PRESIDENT Let me answer that question first We 're going to revisit all of that over the next few days I 'm going to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can do about that With regard to the economic plan I must say I found that rather amazing I do n't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot I 'll be interested to hear what his specifics are but I would go back and read his book and his plan There 's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy But otherwise the plans are remarkably similar So I think it would be I 'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he 's changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear I 'll be glad to hear them Q To follow up sir how do you plan to handle his political criticism He 's launched a campaign against you Do you think you can sit back and just THE PRESIDENT Well first of all I will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me And if he 's changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year then we need to know why and what his ideas are Maybe he 's got some constructive ideas I think the American people have shown that they 're very impatient with people who do n't want to produce results And the one thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last even if they do n't agree with what I do is that I want to get something done I just came here to try to change things I want to do things And I want to do things that help people 's lives So my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good that is constructive that takes us beyond some idea I 've proposed that will change people 's lives for the better fine But I think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the President Q Mr. President to go back to Bosnia for a minute You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis The United States is the last remaining superpower Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally THE PRESIDENT Well the United States surely you would agree that the United States even as the last remaining superpower has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the United Nations Q But you have a mandate and THE PRESIDENT They do and that is one of the things that we have under review I have n't ruled out any option for action I would remind all of you I have not ruled out any option except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there We are not So we are reviewing other options But I also would remind you that to be fair our allies have had the French the British and the Canadians have had troops on the ground there They have been justifiably worried about those But they have supported the airdrops the toughening of the sanctions They welcomed the American delegation now in Europe working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia And I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position and I would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been I do n't have any criticism of the British the French and others about that Q Would that be military action Q Mr. President several of the leading lights in your administration ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N Ambassador to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services Secretary have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you 've taken in your administration Why is that Are you losing your political grip THE PRESIDENT Give me an example Q Example Judge Sessions said that there was no child abuse in Waco Madeleine Albright has said in this morning 's newspapers at least that she favors air strikes in Bosnia All of these are things you said that you did n't support THE PRESIDENT First of all I do n't know what we know that David Koresh had sex with children I think that is undisputed is it not Is it not Does anybody dispute that Where I come from that qualifies as child abuse And we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves I think that qualifies as abuse And I 'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I do n't know exactly what he said In terms of Madeleine Albright Madeleine Albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes There is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her or memo in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next And I have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next And I 'm not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me but in the next few days when I make a decision about what to do then I will announce what I 'm going to do So I would n't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school Q How about the Value Added Tax Mr. President THE PRESIDENT What was that Q The Value Added Tax Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea THE PRESIDENT I do n't mind them saying they think it 's a good idea There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate No decision has been made on that And I have no objection to their expressing their views on that We 've had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy I took no that was n't taking a line against an administration policy Q Mr. President a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations THE PRESIDENT Well I do n't know about that And I do n't know what their it depends on what the expectations are But I 'll tell you this I believe that this country 's policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination I believe when you tell people they ca n't do certain things in this country that other people can do there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it I believe we need the services of all of our people and I have said that consistently And not as a political proposition The first time this issue came up was in 1991 when I was in Boston I was just asked the question about it And I might add it 's interesting that I have been attacked obviously those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in America When I was Governor I was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards I just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities and I 'm going to stick right with that Q Are you concerned sir that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue THE PRESIDENT Yes but I have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it It 's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press I 've just simply taken my position and tried to see it through And that 's what I do It does n't take a lot of my time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do and that 's what I 'll continue to do Q Mr. President getting back to the situation in Bosnia and we understand you have n't made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable But the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes perhaps to cut off supply lines Without telling us your decision presumably you have n't made any final decisions on those two options what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision THE PRESIDENT I 'm reluctant to get into this There are those are two of the options There are some other options that have been considered All have pluses and minuses all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the Congress where I would remind you heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy I do believe that on the air strike issue the pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military action apply there If you take action if the United States takes action we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear The United States is not should not become involved as a partisan in a war With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace Will it lead to more bloodshed What kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration along with some other options we have Q Do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we have n't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we could n't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from Vietnam And now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of Agent Orange How can we afford to go to any more of these wars THE PRESIDENT Well I think that 's a good argument against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there But we are after all the world 's only super power We do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences and goodness knows there have been many but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist Q Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the Serbs until after Sunday And in general how has his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia THE PRESIDENT No I have not made any agreement and he did not ask for that We never even discussed that interestingly enough The Russians I would remind you in the middle of President Yeltsin 's campaign abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper decision for them and one that the United States and I 'm sure the rest of the free world very much appreciated Q Do you wish Mr. President that you 'd become more involved in the planning of the Waco operation And how would you handle that situation differently now THE PRESIDENT I do n't think as a practical matter that the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail One of the things that I 'm sure will come out when we look into this is the questions will be asked and answered did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten And I look forward to that But at the time I have to say as I did before the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed once we knew that the FBI was going to go in was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi as least military nature of the conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them And then on the day before the action I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I have reported to you previously and which at the time I thought were sufficient I have as I said I 'm sure I leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should have asked Q Mr. President what is your assessment of Director Sessions role in the Waco affair And have you made a decision on his future And if you have n't will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide THE PRESIDENT Well first of all I have no assessment of his role since I had no direct contact with him And I mean no negative or positive inference I have no assessment there I stand by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI And I 'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what to do with the direction of the FBI Q Mr. President since you said that one side in Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to the nth degree why do you then tell us that the United States can not take a partisan view in this war THE PRESIDENT Well I said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war in effect to redraw the lines geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia or that that would ultimately be successful I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing And that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face and that all of our allies face And if it were easy I suppose it would have been solved before We have tried to do more in the last 90 days than was previously done It has clearly not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression and we are now looking at what else we can do Q Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets Are n't there steps like that that would not involve conflict direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider THE PRESIDENT There may be I would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different We were then at war with Germany at the time and that 's what made that whole incident so series of incidents so perplexing But we have as I say we 've got all of our options under review Q The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge of collapse What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation THE PRESIDENT Well you may know something I do n't That 's not what our people tell me I think Mr. Caputo and Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job The thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there It 's obvious what their concerns are They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the first place and President Aristide we feel should be restored to power We 're working toward that I get a report on that we discuss it at least three times a week and I 'm convinced that we 're going to prevail there and be successful I do believe that there 's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society But I believe we 're going to prevail there Q Mr. President would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you Laughter THE PRESIDENT Well I 'll say if I believe first of all we passed the budget resolution in record time That was the biggest issue That confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society reversing a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up while the deficit went from 1 trillion to 4 trillion the total national debt and the deficit continued to go up We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages We have lower interest rates across the board We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt We have established a new environmental policy which is dramatically different The Secretary of Education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards as well as increasing opportunity We have done an enormous amount of work on political reform on campaign finance and lobbying reform And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration 's officials These things are consistent with not only what I said I 'd do in the campaign but with turning the country around The Vice President is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country We are working on a whole range of other things The welfare reform initiative to move people from welfare to work And of course a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of Americans So I think it is amazing how much has been done More will be done We also passed the Family Leave bill A version of the motor voter bill that has not come out of conference back to me yet And everything has been passed except the stimulus program So I think we 're doing fine and we 're moving in the right direction I feel good about it Q Sir a follow-up Would n't you say though that one of your biggest initiatives aid to Soviet Russia is now practically finished if we ca n't pass a stimulus bill in our own country how can we do it for them THE PRESIDENT Let me recast the question a little bit It 's a good question laughter it 's a good question but to be fair we 've got to recast it We have already the first round of aid to the Soviet to non-Soviet Russia to a democratic Russia is plainly going to go through the first 1.6 billion The aid that we agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the international financial institutions which is a big dollar item is plainly going to go through The question is can we get any more aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States Congress And that is a question I think Mary that will be resolved in the weeks ahead in part by what happens to the American workers and their jobs and their future I think the two things will be tied by many members of Congress Q The tailhook report came out this morning documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the Navy How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy THE PRESIDENT First let me comment a little on that The Inspector General 's report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way I also want to say to the American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined It should not be taken as a general indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who serve there It is very specific in its allegations and it will be pursued The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the Navy and the only thing I should have said to him I think is that I expected him to take the report and to do his duty And I believe he will do that Q Mr. President to back to Russia for just a minute The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms THE PRESIDENT I understand that Q Can you live with a split laughter can you live with a split decision though or do you need both passed in order to then build support for Russian aid THE PRESIDENT I believe the answer to your question is for the United States the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy which is who wins the election If he wins the election if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as their President then I think we should do our best to work with him toward reform You know we had a lot of other countries here for the Holocaust Museum dedication their leaders were here Leaders from Eastern Europe leaders from at least one republic of the former Soviet Union all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there 's economic slowdown everywhere And in a world in which there 's economic slowdown and difficulty all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they have n't produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for You can understand that But if they have confidence in the leadership I think that 's all we can ask And the United States will if the Russian people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the United States will continue to work with him I think he is a genuine democrat small d and genuinely committed to reform I think that we should support that Q Mr. President Mr. Perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement NAFTA How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished THE PRESIDENT I think we 'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future You know our people are still working with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side agreements We 're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say what the labor agreement will say and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is The Mexicans say and there is some merit to their position that they 're worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission Even in the United States to be fair we have some folks who are worried about that about giving that up On the other hand if we 're going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them So what we 're trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations if you keep on violating it past a certain point maybe not an isolated incident but a pattern of violation there is going to be some enforcement There must be consequences And we 're working out the details of that But I still feel quite good about it And this is just an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others I think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America and gives us a bigger world in which to trade I think that 's the only way a rich country can grow richer If you look at what Japan and other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own region it 's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area So this is an idea battle You know you 've got a lot of questions and I want to answer them all but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics you know who 's for this and who 's for that and if this person is for this somebody else has got to be for that A lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas over who 's right and wrong about the world toward which we 're moving And the answers are not self-evident And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way So I just have a difference of opinion I believe that the concept of NAFTA is sound even though as you know I thought that the details needed to be improved Q Mr. President there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners General Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic he believes that it was incorrect Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue And more broadly do you believe that in fact the Vietnamese did return all the American prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord THE PRESIDENT First let me say I saw General Vessey before he went to Vietnam and after he returned And I have a high regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way As to whether the document had any basis in fact let me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim I do not know whether that is right or wrong We are having it basically evaluated at this time and when we complete the evaluation we 'll tell you And of course we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs I think that we 'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange but I can not say that I 'm fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know There are still some cases that we do n't know the answer to But I do believe we 're making some progress I was encouraged by the last trip Q I 'd like to follow up on that Before the U.S. normalizes relations allows trade to go forward do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith THE PRESIDENT A lot of experts say you can never resolve every case every one that we could n't resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved going back to the Second World War But what I would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time and that there was a complete open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases And we 're not there yet Again I have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this And I confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment I just am very influenced by how the families feel Q your economic stimulus package are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans your legislative plans for the coming year including the crime bill the health care initiative and other things Are there any plans to do that And also did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob Dole THE PRESIDENT No what I underestimated was the extent to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over 500 billion in deficit reduction When they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments I thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture and I underestimated that I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise that it would not be rebuffed Instead every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the Majority Leader about So it was a strange set of events But I think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan but not the major part of it acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits so that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately Mr. President I 'd like to be for this but I ca n't now And we 're all strung out and we 're divided And I think we need to do a reality check As I said what I want to know let me go back to what I said what I want to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on and Republicans or Democrats is what could I have done differently to make it come out differently Because the real losers here were not the President and the administration The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who wo n't have jobs now We could have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer I mean we could have done a lot of good things with that money And I think that is very very sad And it became more political than it should have But the underlying rationale I do n't think holds a lot of water that it was deficit spending That just wo n't wash. Q and redo THE PRESIDENT No I mean you know for example you mentioned the crime bill I think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill I mean the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year And they were all fighting over the Brady Bill Surely surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months with the kind of mindless violence we have seen we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun And surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street That 's another thing that I really believe that once we move some of that money not all but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who 'd been laid off that would be a compelling case I mean people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill Q Mr. President back to the tailhook report for a second That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy 's senior leadership in general but did not name any of the senior officers Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las Vegas should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers THE PRESIDENT You should know that under the rules of law which apply to this I am in the chain of command There is now an Inspector General 's report and the law must take its course If I were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case I do n't really think I think all I can tell you is what I have already said I was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the Inspector General 's report and I want appropriate action to be taken Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken I have been advised that because I am the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con So I ca n't say any more except to say that I want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way Q Mr. President could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia You said that you were not considering introduction of American forces Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces sir THE PRESIDENT I said ground forces Q You said ground forces Could I ask you sir if you fear that using U.S. air strikes might draw the United States into a ground war there THE PRESIDENT I just do n't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore I 've told you that there 's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there Q With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington this weekend for the march did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities THE PRESIDENT No Q Why not THE PRESIDENT Because I and basically I would n't participate in other marches I think once you become President on balance except under unusual circumstances that is not what should be done But more importantly I 'm going to the American Society of Newspaper Editors a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now And I expect that I will say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here asking for a climate that is free of discrimination asking basically to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other American citizens if they do that and just that And that 's always been my position not only for the gays who will be here but for others as well Thank you very much"

science,sci.med,Serum actually but plasma numbers are the same Whole blood numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower roughly 5 to 10 percent lower I find the following range for whole blood in FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY N. W. Teitz editor W. B. Saunders 1987 Human glucose whole blood fasting levels 60 95 Indeed they do measure whole blood levels although they are not as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory One problem is that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the sample is drawn reducing the apparent level According to Teitz however results compare reasonably well with laboratory results although values below 80 tend to be lower with strip tests whereas values above 240 can be very erratic As stated above whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 percent lower than serum levels Sample freshness will affect whole blood levels however I do n't believe there is a well- defined conversion factor since cell metabolism will affect samples to varying degrees The serum/plasma test is much preferred for any except general ball park testing

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts as I understand them If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80 you can replace the i386 chip with either 1 a Cyrix 486DLC chip for 130 which will increase your processing power by about 60 for normal fuctions and not at all for math functions This chip will only run at your original clock speed ie if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz note Windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows Or 2 you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for 450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100 if you were running at 25MHz originally But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed There is also 3 the Kingston 486/NOW platform for 750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it This might speed up your math functions as well but I am not sure If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX ie it runs at either 25 or 33MHz in it then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip which is really an i486DX2 chip and replace your chip with it You should get about 95 better preformance for both normal and math functions The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs 450 and the 33/66MHz version costs 700 The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run If you have a 20MHz 486SX then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz ie 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week You might want to shop around as prices do vary If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip e-mail me and I will respond with a couple of sources Lawrence Khoo

politics,talk.politics.mideast,This a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search Certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm 's way Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel should totally back down So the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves What So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over again While I also hope for this to happen it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their soil They have to Prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way Israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti-Israel guerillas in-residence Good lord Brad What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in It can ask them to leave at any time as Nasser did in '56 and '67 Somehow with that limitation on the troops powers I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable Without a genuine commitment to peace from the Arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the UN is worthless to Israel but perhaps useful as a ruse Perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate If however you call on Israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian Arab and Islamic groups From Israel 's perspective concessions gets it NOTHING except the realization that it has given something up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise Words can be taken back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above 1 Israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state involved 2 that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups 3 Israel would prepare for the next round of attacks What would Israel want to return to those days and do n't be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of present-day Arab states Ah ok what is different about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards Israel Now do n't talk about vague political factors but about those tangible just like that which Israel gave up factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states Your assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states do n't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing It has not Without the support and active involvement of Syria Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain control If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel Tim

Actually the melting point of most iron alloys and steels are iron alloys is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.

science,sci.space,I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions were going to be funded I do n't remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement In any case he was asked about that very matter Why ca n't we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going His responce was that there are only so many available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a COBE Magellan Hubble etc is 5-10 years minumum If he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects If he did that sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments Just as he had benefited from his predicessor 's funding choices he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them

politics,talk.politics.mideast,"Well if you put things into historical perspective the Turks moved into an area which was inhabited by Greeks This is how the history between the two nations started some centuries ago Since then it has been a continuous battle between the two nations From my perspective I ca n't see why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened between the two nations Of course it would not be reasonable to argue that the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area This isn't going to happen so the best would be to improve the relations between the two countries A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus If things ca n't work there there is n't any possible way that could work between our nations I always avoid to discuss such things I consider it a waist of my time Besides as I said I do not want to open a new flame I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece in Turkey Each one will leave at least 1,000 so go and figure what this means to your economy If you had kept the visa requirement how many Greeks would bother to visit Turkey Come on Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience You err if you think you 'd get a reasonable conclusion"

politics,talk.politics.misc,"Procedural note Ted directed followups to misc.legal only While I respect his right to do so my own opinions are that 1 Followup-To fields are mere suggestions not mandatory commands and 2 this issue is of sufficient a general political relevance and b civil liberties interest to warrant keeping it active in t.p.m and a.s.c-l as well at least for this round Okay now here 's my interpretation of _Boomer_ based on the facts as presented in the New York Court of Appeals holding _Boomer v. Note The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their highest court Supreme Court Supreme Judicial Court or Supreme Court of Appeals Maryland and New York call theirs simply the Court of Appeals To make matters worse New York also calls its _second-highest_ court the Supreme Court Appellate Division Atlantic Cement 26 N.Y.2d 219 257 N.E.2d 870 1970 Oscar H. Boomer et al. owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's plant near Albany N.Y. The fact pattern gives no information as to which came first the plaintiff 's acquisition of the land or he defendant 's start of production at their cement plant In the course of its regular operations the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs property via dirt smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief that is they asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property Commentary this seems entirely reasonable to me Boomer at al owned their property and presumably a right to quiet enjoyment of it Atlantic Cement 's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right Instead of granting the plaintiffs request for an injunction the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property provided that Atlantic Cement paid them 185,000 in compensatory damages In other words the court granted Atlantic Cement Co. a private party the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain A taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it 's done by the state allowing a private firm to do it is in my opinion totally wrong Yes I know the _Boomer_ court did n't call it eminent domain But if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain Let me take issue with the way you 've presented the case you say that What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge did n't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over 185,000 in damages Blackmail Pulls out Black 's Law Dictionary Abridged 5th Edition Blackmail Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm to injure property to accuse of crime or to expose disgraceful defects This crime is commonly included under extortion statutes How do you define as blackmail one party 's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying Or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price As I see it Boomer et al having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted There is n't or at least should n't be any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings You go on to say The plant would never have been shut down the plaintiff 's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than 185K to having the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation If so so what Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties If Atlantic Cement did n't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business well should n't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_ business I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation that was Atlantic Cement 's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did And then you say Everyone 's property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided As above I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole They were in fact by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them And for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole And again I ask Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided If so I 've been miseducated I always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done 1 _Boomer_ is not being taught as infamous at least not at my school Aside Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year mandatory classes such as Torts where I first encountered _Boomer_ instructors who regardless of their personal opinions can and do teach the law neutrally When the students get into their second and third years in which the students a can pick and choose which courses to take except for the mandatory Professional Responsibility of course and b are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions This is especially true of part-time instructors who in real life are practicing attorneys or sitting judges this can be _very_ educational sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar End of aside I called it infamous because that 's my opinion of it For the reasons I 've stated above I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can only call economic correctness over justice 2 It is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement 's wrongful acts And if you believe that it is correct for the courts or any other branch of government to grant to private parties the right to take other people 's property by eminent domain Really I did n't know that what if anything has he had to say about cases like _Boomer_ I 've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as law and economics is weak If it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many tie-breaker factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute as measured by the scale of justice is evenly balanced fine But as illustrated by _Boomer_ it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case"

religion,soc.religion.christian,In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have given the impression that even though children did n't require baptism it would n't hurt if they were To the contrary when you baptize children before they are capable of comprehending it you deny them their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to serve God Have any of you considered that children are not accountable for sin because they are not capable of repentance Peter said to a group of men and brethren Repent and be baptized every one of you Acts 2:38 Notice that he specified that if they repent then they may be baptized In following Peter 's instructions people must first demonstrate repentance a forsaking of their sins and a desire to obey God 's commands before they are eligible to be baptized Since young children are not capable of repenting they are not eligible for baptism And since God is both just and merciful sin is not imputed when there is no law Romans 5:13 young children are not accountable for what they ca n't comprehend

politics,talk.politics.mideast,"Because the x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide And they are doing 'it again Are you so blind Kurds R us Armenians R not Excuse me We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead Ohanus Appressian Men Are Like That p. 202 A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race This is the worst crime in history It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian dictatorship 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable It is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the Turkish genocide I understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been well documented over the past six decades We can not reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race Source Bristol Papers General Correspondence Container 32 Bristol to Bradley Letter of September 14 1920 I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in the Caucasus attacked Tartar Turkish villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants pillage the village and often burn the village Why not And the Germans were subject to Jewish Genocide Are you for real Tell me 'Halsall were you high on ASALA/SDPA/ARF forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that Where is your non-existent list of scholars Here is mine During the First World War and the ensuing years 1914-1920 the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government and international political leaders such as U.S Ambassador Mark Bristol William Langer Ambassador Layard James Barton Stanford Shaw Arthur Chester John Dewey Robert Dunn Papazian Nalbandian Ohanus Appressian Jorge Blanco Villalta General Nikolayef General Bolkovitinof General Prjevalski General Odiselidze Meguerditche Kazimir Motayef Twerdokhlebof General Hamelin Rawlinson Avetis Aharonian Dr. Stephan Eshnanie Varandian General Bronsart Arfa Dr. Hamlin Boghos Nubar Sarkis Atamian Katchaznouni Rachel Bortnick Halide Edip McCarthy W.

Michigan so the list goes on and on and on Now wait there is more Mark Alan Epstein 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries Klaus Schwarz Werlag Freiburg 1980 page 19 During the fifteenth century when the Ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the Balkans there was considerable turmoil among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe Even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which Ottoman life particularly when compared to life in Europe held for the Jews There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews fled to Ottoman territory The regularity of these reports suggests that the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and eastward from Western and Central Europe It is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of Jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward Muslim East. page 21 In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the city He was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century Sarfati himself was from Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the Ottoman Jews prevailed upon him to write their European coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the Ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to Palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there. page 41 the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the Ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the Christians of Europe Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed European sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers In addition it appears that Christian pirates plundered Turks and Jews their sworn enemies and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who regularly reported to the Ottomans There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans in the struggle against European powers The two best known instances of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda in the early sixteenth century and of Rhodes We also have reports of sympathy for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios An unpublished Ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some Greek towns page 43 It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved Jews Muslims and Christians were aware of the situation. page 46 it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not particularly cordial The two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity If there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between Muslims and Jews neither of whom had much in common with the Orthodox. page 46 The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element The Jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian countries to Ottoman domains. page 151 From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the Ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines and the protection and the security which the Ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the Jews recognized their mutual interests page 161 It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century That they played an important role in both can not be doupted It is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the Ottomans as well as did the Jews It is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the Jews did Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home. A version of Rabbi Sarfati 's Tzarfati letter is given by Prof.Shaw page 32 Your cries and sobs reached us We have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands I hear the lamentation of my brethren The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people The priests and prelates of Rome have risen They wish to root out the memory of Jacob and erase the name of Israel They always devise new persecutions They wish to bring you to the stake Listen my brethren to the counsel I will give you I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German rabbis I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land which is blessed by God and filled with all good things Here I found rest and happiness Turkey can also become for you the land of peace If you who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with in this land you would not consider any difficulties you would set out to come to us Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain of We possess great fortunes much gold and silver in our hands We are not oppressed with heavy taxes and our commerce is free and unhindered Rich are the fruits of the earth Everything is cheap and every one of us lives in peace and freedom Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame as is the case in Germany where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold Arise my brethren gird up your loins collect your forces and come to us Here you will be free of your enemies here you will find rest 13 13 Israel Zinberg A History Of Jewish Literature vol.V The Jewish Center of Culture in the Ottoman Empire Hebrew Union College Press Ktav Publishers New York 1974 Serdar Argic"

science,sci.crypt,I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all However using the info they gather while listening they can go searching THE right place and find good strong evidence which they can use in court Question currently it is easy to wire-tap from the technical point of view at least Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station The police also obviously The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the non-authorized person to eavesdrop note that I DO NOT write impossible The privacy will thus improve from the current situation Poeple who REALLY have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things If an illegal operation is really worth one can afford having critical data carried by a person rather than sending it electronically The clipper chip will not change this The problem is more politic Foreign countries will never accept the clipper chip is the access to the escrow can not be directly granted to their own police following their OWN law not the US law i.e each country will have its own escrow How then will it be possible to monitor the international traffic or will encrypted international traffic be possible or will there be an international escrow some kind of U.N. thing Forbidding crypted communication is impractical how is it possible to spot a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate on the various existing networks What about private networks And this will be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase in the next years I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the risk of for instance one 's girlfriend 's husband listening to his wife's communications It will bring no more as regards to security Is it worth I think so if its cost is limited I think that many privacy invasions are done not only by official services but also by private entities The clipper can help reducing these Provided we do not hope too much of it it is not a real danger and it can be helpful

science,sci.electronics,Just MHO but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four of them open spread across the bed next to the desk in my dorm and reference them while using the program full-screen The Windows Help things come closest to good on-line documentation I 've seen but they generally are n't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of space even compressed which is at a premium on my system In fact the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borland 's compiler instead of using the one the lab licensed in the lab of course I 've got a SHELF full of books to help me out when I 'm stuck To each his own We 've destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac 5.0 and Word for Windows may have been a bad batch of disks Do n't have the faintest idea what happened to them they just went bad Were n't stored near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated indeed they were only used once Given this and the massive headaches finding a working set of disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down I 'd say having working backups is a godsend I sure wish we 'd had them Sometimes I think Murphy 's Law holds true more often than Newton 's when we needed them I think it 's sortof like snake antivenin 99.995 of the time you have absolutely no use for it but when you need it BOY do you ever need it I do n't have backups of my originals at home but then my machine does n't see anywhere NEAR the use/abuse of these here at the lab and so I consider it less of a risk Still I usually make working copies of them when I install them and then eventually re-use these working copies for something else Just mine too BTW before anyone notices my mentioning copying programs from machine to machine when we do installs here and wonders about the licensing the upper-management non-student staff of course are METICULOUS in checking with providers of the software and making SURE we are sticking to the license agreements
religion,soc.religion.christian,First of all ceremonial law is an extraScriptural term It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture But if you look at Collosions without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath can not be a ceremonial law you will see that it does refer to the sabbath against us to His cross and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat what we drink the keeping of new moons and holy days or the keeping of the sabbath The word for sabbath in this verse is sabbaton and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law this is one of them and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption the sabbath can not be a ceremonial law then he will have to find some way around it like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day Because the sabbath can not be a ceremonial law But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings Also why is the sabbath absent from the epistles except for Hebrews 4 which talks about the rest that comes through faith Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day Especially slaves Many new converst were slaves It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory Why is there no mention of this in the epistles

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,There is a fine line between getting players input and knuckling under to players demands A manager much like a military officer needs to have his her players complete obedience and respect during a game After the game it 's no big deal but when there is no time to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart see Boston Red Sox ff Strawberry 's demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like demands I suspect that a comment like I enjoy hitting fourth I'm used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from Strawberry Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best in that role Paraphrased by my memory and bias That seems like a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order A more media-sensitive player might answer The manager knows what he is doing If he thinks that batting me third will help the team then I am all for it We 'd ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl 's response as petulant Personally I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't matter much in which order the 2-5 players in the order are batted except for personal stats If I were Darryl I 'd probably answer that question The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get paid for RBIs I think it is best for me to bat fourth but I am willing to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team or something like that It would be helpful at salary time my RBIs were down because I was hitting third and make him sound like a team player Since Strawberry will not likely go through arbitration but use the free agent market for his next contract maybe that argument is useless but it would help his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free

Page i Volume 6 Number 11 April 25 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR Rates of Cesarean Delivery United States 1991 SOURCE MMWR 42 15 DATE Apr 23 1993 Cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the United States since 1986 Table 1 The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 21 reporting countries exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico 1 This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC 's National Hospital Discharge Survey NHDS for 1991 and compares these data with previous years Data on discharges from short-stay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS conducted by CDC 's National Center for Health Statistics For 1991 medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean VBAC presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 11 women discharged after delivery The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from national vital registration data Therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the NHDS 2 Stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95 confidence level based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of 1.96 In 1991 there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 Table 1 The primary cesarean rate i.e. number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans for 1986-1991 also was stable ranging from 16.8 to 17.5 In 1991 the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6 significantly p 0.05 higher than the rates for the West 19.8 Midwest 21.8 and Northeast 22.6 Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment Table 2 The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries Since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older women increased however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3 essentially the same as the 23.5 observed Based on the NHDS of the approximately live births in 1991 an HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6 Number 11 April 25 1993 estimated 966,000 23.5 were by cesarean delivery Of these an estimated 338,000 35.0 births were repeat cesareans and 628,000 65.0 were primary cesareans Since 1986 approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually In 1986 8.5 of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with 24.2 in 1991 Of all cesareans in 1991 35.0 were associated with a previous cesarean 30.4 with dystocia i.e. failure of labor to progress 11.7 with breech presentation 9.2 with fetal distress and 13.7 with all other specified complications The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days In comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days and for a repeat cesarean 4.2 days nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries 2.2 days or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs 2.3 days In 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days for primary cesareans 5.2 days for repeat cesareans 4.7 days and for VBAC and non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days respectively Reported by Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems National Center for Health Statistics CDC Editorial Note The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986 however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 3 Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 14.8 Postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births 5 Moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs For example in 1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and 4720 respectively The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 23.5 the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 617,000 versus 966,000 resulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986 several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery For example VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 7 Of women who are offered a trial of labor 50 -70 could deliver vaginally 7 a level already achieved by many hospitals 8 Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6 Number 11 April 25 1993 national data are available 9 when the VBAC rate according to NHDS data was 5.7 The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35 based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted To reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peer-review process 10 Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery

Malaria Br Div of Parasitic Diseases National Center for Infectious Diseases CDC Editorial Note In Uganda the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum however in some areas e.g. Thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness In Africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92 1 Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period The risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis e.g. psychosis and convulsions is low i.e. 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2 while the risk for less severe adverse reactions e.g. dizziness gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics 1 Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen 3,4 Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance e.g. Southeast Asia and Africa In Africa for persons who can not take mefloquine or doxycycline chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative although less effective regimen Chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum has not been reported Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 6 Volume 6 Number 11 April 25 1993 on the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are available from Health Information for International Travel 1992 i.e. yellow book 5 or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax 404 332-4555 References 1 Lobel HO Miani M Eng T et al Long-term malaria prophylaxis with weekly mefloquine in Peace Corps volunteers an effective and well tolerated regimen Lancet 1993 341:848-51 2 World Health Organization Review of central nervous system adverse events related to the antimalarial drug mefloquine 1985-1990 Geneva World Health Organization 1991 publication no WHO/MAL/91.1063 3 Pang L Limsomwong N Singharaj P.

written by Jody Dove March 1993 National Institute of Dental Research At the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection held January 31-February 3 in San Francisco participants explored issues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosal immunology and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology School of Dentistry University of California San Francisco An international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries including Asia Africa Europe Central America South America as well as the United States and Canada Support tor the workshop was provided by the National Institute of Dental Research the National Cancer Institute the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the NIH Office of AIDS Research and the Procter and Gamble Company Among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of HIV lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision of oral care to the HIV-positive population salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric HIV infection and women 's issues Recommendations Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV to establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions Epidemiology Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6 Number 11 April 25 1993 radically changed In 1988 HIV infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs Today more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis They also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression and prognosis Social/political Issues Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection focused on changing the public 's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patients and the need to educate the public about what AIDS is and how it is acquired Saliva and Salivary Glands Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1 aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and 2 direct effects on the virus or target cells Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity Pediatric Issues Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest With early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of HIV- infected children has tripled The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother 's sero-status is known prior to giving birth Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 12 Volume 6 Number 11 April 25 1993 Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection Recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy Occupational and Treatment Issues Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit of HIV testing patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of HIV-infected patients Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence Company in late 1993 end of part 1"

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,"stuff deleted I agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific argument That has great hands means nothing It seems to me that a first-baseman 's defensive value is not entirely or even primarily from his ability to field grounders or catch popups How many such chances does he get during a game Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B SS,3B and P I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well even if they are high up-the-line or in the dirt Good Hands are needed for such plays and thus have value I do n't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays but I 'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar It 's just like you do n't judge catcher 's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups But not as marked I suppose"

politics,talk.politics.misc,THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary Vancouver British Columbia BACKGROUND BRIEFING BY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS April 4 1993 Canada Place Vancouver British Columbia 9:40 A.M. PST Folks we 're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Good morning The President President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia and it 's valued at 1.6 billion Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package I want to make a few points First this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently are available so in effect all of these programs can begin tomorrow The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government Third the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you Fourth I 'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment I think it 's fair to say that Russia 's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars No collection of governments can meet those needs only the private sector can do so And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship If it would be helpful I 'd be prepared to run down the first page which is a summary of U.S. assistance and just give you some general background on what these programs are I 'll do it quickly and then I 'll be glad to take questions The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure there 's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities That 's 194 million in grant that is from Food for Progress the grant portion of Food for Progress We 'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies and that 's 30 million The second item is concessional food sales As you know the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia It 's important to us and it 's important to Russia that we continue that relationship The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program The value over the next seven months is 700 million These are concessional terms The exact terms have not been worked out but I think it 's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal The third program is a collection of private sector support We think this is one of the most important things we 're going to do Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at 50 million And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia to take equity positions in those businesses The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis He has also agreed the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself I think it 's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia You see that we have a total of 48 million in programs various programs The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we 're launching The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration This is a demonstration project What we 'd like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that whether it 's with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction And so we 've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units We 'll be working very closely with the Russian military on this And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project The sixth area is energy in the environment They are two issues that the President feels strongly about Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production both oil and gas and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems which cause so much environmental damage I 've talked a little bit about trade and investment about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin a business development committee which will work in all other sectors of the economy to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time And the point I 'd like to make here is trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important to draw an analogy as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it senior people on a full-time basis because it is terribly important You 'll notice that the United States is going to support Russia 's membership in the GATT Russia has had observer status Russia has requested our support and in fact requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount a very important goal And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT We are also supporting their access to GSP the Generalized System of Preferences You 'll note that Ex-Im has extended 82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia that OPIC has extended 150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project I 'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a 2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services We think this is a very important development We think we 'll get there by April 14th which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference the G-7 conference Before I take any further questions I 'd like to defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance objectives with you SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements Recently we completed in Moscow three I think very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs The first is the program of 130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program That is for submarines for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement 130 million The second is a 75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility And finally a 10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system So we add that 215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing about 150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians Kazhaks and Belarussians Belarus for example has just in the last couple of weeks received up to 65 million in FY'93 funds for safety security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I an agreement to accede to NPT So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols and will continue to work very hard with them And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process Q The OPIC funds to is that for the field in Kazhakstan and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan Why do you feel now it is necessary if it 's the same one why do you feel it 's necessary SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL It 's not the same deal Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan the Tenges oil field This is a new investment project It 's a polar lights oil development and renovation project and it 's being announced today So it 's completely new Q Can you tell us more about what 's involved SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Yes Conoco like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things One to prospect for new oil in Siberia west Siberia and two to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines both oil and gas in Russia The objective here obviously is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia increase energy production which will in turn increase hard currency revenues which is what Russia needs So we think this deal is very very good development for Russia The Russians do as well and it 's good for an American company And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee Q So it 's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL That 's right Q On that point should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the 2 billion SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Well as you know Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated And we think it will And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th there will be 2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services Q That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their wo n't be and their will or there wo n't be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL There 's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility the 2-billion facility once it is concluded will soak up a lot of that interest But I think the interest may even extend beyond that And if so the government will respond Q What 's the current year budget costs of that 2-billion agreement should it go forward And is there any current year budget costs SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I 'll have to refer you to Ex-Im for that I do n't know the details of that Q The concessional food sales is there any current year costs to that or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress which is a USDA program USDA has the funds we do n't need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds There will be a hit in the budget I 'd refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that Q Can you talk about the Democracy Corps Q and the private sector how many folks are going to be involved in that SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Why do n't I start with the Democracy Corps first I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area And so the administration felt the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts And so this is a presidential initiative It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union And we 're very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation Q any kind of commitment yet any kind of word yet on FY'94 and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the 300 million the President talked about SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL The administration is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of 700 million What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform He 'll be consulting with the Congress When he returns to Washington he 'll be consulting also with the other ally governments and we 'll make a decision at that time Q Two questions about the 700 billion agricultural money First of all I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food So why did you decide to do it that way Secondly could you explain agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russia 's inability to pay How does this fit into that situation SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL As you know the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities agricultural products to Russia I think between 1991 and '92 we had extended a little bit of history here about 5.5 billion in credits credit guarantees through the Commodity Credit Corporation That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products On December 1 of last year '92 the Russian government stopped its payments on that program They are now in arrears to us on that program and therefore by law the United States can not continue that program And so the President working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales And I think we have two ways to do that We 've announced today 194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program But we do not have sufficient authority to spend 700 million in grant food and so we looked for a concessional loan program I think everybody agrees that Russia that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now but a long-term concessional loan program would And that is what this program is It will provide once the final details are worked out for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal And then from years seven through 15 which is the life of the deal it will provide for concessional rates of interest generally around three to four percent And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years but it will also continue this very important grain relationship which is important for them and it 's important for the American farm community Q I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit the Russians failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through is that right SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Let me be explicit about that We are prevented under the law to from continuing the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russia 's arrearages to the United States All of you know about those arrearages They total about I think around 640 million USDA can give you an exact figure So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance knowing that we could n't take it from the grant programs because we do n't have sufficient authority there we looked at Food for Progress which is a program we 've used to great effect in other parts of the world And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments Q Where do those funds actually come from SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL They come from the Food for Progress program which is a program under USDA 's authority USDA has the authority to spend these funds We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds And I want to make that general point again Everything in this package the 1.6 billion package comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow And it 's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year that we meet these commitments And we are confident we 'll be able to do so Q How did you arrive at the figure of 700 million does that max out that program or did you actually have a range from 0 to SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL There 's a reason for it The reason was that the Russian government told us that 's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably 100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which time Russia wo n't require the same level of food imports from the West Q I would imagine there 's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine with Georgia with some of the other republics SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Yes we 're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union We have told ourselves and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that you see roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries In the area of food sales we have been active with Ukraine in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia We will continue that And I think it 's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they 're hard-hitting Q Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing legalities bureaucracy SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Well one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight not only the economic agenda but also trade and investment And I 'd like to refer to the point I made at the beginning We 're convinced in talking about this problem the problem of how to support Russia long-term we 're convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private sector can do that We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector It is a very good match with what the Russians need now which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production That 's what the Russian government has told us it wants to do and so that 's why we have made such a major emphasis on it That 's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks and in fact figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton And we 're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia that the United States through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce will be there to support them Q My question is is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL We think he is I would note that President Yeltsin 's Prime Minister Mr. Chernomyrdin worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President Vice President Gore to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee And we 're looking forward to the work Q What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here It depends on the program itself In most cases though we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent that the money gets to the intended source That 's an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs But they are all quite different For instance in the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food For grant medical assistance we 've been working through Project Hope which is a private organization For the housing for instance the resettlement of Russian officers we 'll be working with a group of American PBOs On some of the democratization projects we 're working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations We 're working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and they 're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways Some directly with the Russian government some with Russian citizens Q The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain can you tell us what the President has to do on that SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Well as George noted yesterday President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship The President has noted that I think it 's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions and we 'll get back to the Russian government Q You were not prepared for these questions when you got here SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL We were prepared for these questions We 've looked at them But we 're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend They require let me just explain particularly on Jackson-Vanik They require consultation with the Congress They require consultation with the American Jewish community And we 're very sensitive to those concerns And so we 'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action Q Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL As I said at the beginning the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts In effect they can all begin tomorrow and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow And that 's the advantage of this particular initiative Q If this as the President says is a long-term long-haul thing and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow why are n't you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I think we 've been clear about that The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects and ideas that he has We have a major congressional delegation that left last night headed by Representative Gephardt and we 'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything And we 'll also want to consult with our allies So that 's where it stands now Q We 've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I think that we 've said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act there were some funds that were left over from FY'92 And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended We did n't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY'92 funds We went into some of the agency allocations Ex-Im OPIC and USDA and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA We could not go forward legally and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales and we think we found it Q Where for example are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL That 's from the Freedom Support Act funds Q In other words all of the money is being directly spent in new ways so to speak SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Most of the grant projects that you see if you look at the general chart the second chart it 's broken down into grant and credits And if you look under grants the technical cooperation projects that total 281.9 million that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92 The Nunn-Lugar funds of course you know about the legislative history of those funds Q cooperation SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL From FY '92 I do n't have the exact figure It was not a considerable figure Q Could you tell us please has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START for START I and II as a result of what 's happened here SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Both presidents President Yeltsin and President Clinton will be discussing this issue this morning In fact we have n't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues That will be this morning 's session I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us We 've been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them Up to this point this has been a very important negotiation that 's been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion help to move things forward essentially But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend I do n't yet know In a couple hours we 'll know Q Just a follow-up on the financing here Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris since it 's all current year appropriations have you taken it from anyplace that 's been earmarked and put it into this fund SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL There are smoke and mirrors here and I think it 's an important point to note We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding We 're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects for instance the enterprise funds the privatization effort the housing effort And we 've already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package but we wanted to make a point This package is FY '93 It 's funds that we have And we 're going to do what we say we 're going to do And the President feels very strongly about that In the past there is a legacy that the western governments the combination of governments put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we 're not able to meet them we 're determined and the President is determined to carry out every single program in this package And we 'll do it But we do have a longer-term commitment and that 's part of the discussions on economics this weekend We 're looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform And we 've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year Q taken it way from any SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL No we have n't Okay the question is have we reprogrammed any of these funds so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia The answer is no we have not done so Q In terms of funding there is no available monies left and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else Does n't that in fact support the theory SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Not at all I do n't think it does That 's a particular example and the example is grain sales The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months You all know about Russia 's debt problem and Russia was unable to meet those commitments So we looked for a way to do two things to meet Russia 's requirement for grain They 're a net grain importer on a massive scale and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia And we simply look for another way to finance that And we have legislative authority to do it This program has been successful in other areas We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union but we thought we should now Q Is n't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL No I do n't think that 's a fair characterization A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991 in 1992 This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made But we had a long six to seven week review of this program We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund which was just an idea but the idea had not been filled out with a program There was no number attached to it In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort I would say is another Clinton initiative Further we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons And President Clinton has responded to that And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we 're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps which is another new initiative we 're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government to achieve that objective So I would not characterize it that way at all And as most of you know I am a career civil servant I was in the last administration I 'm very familiar with what the last administration did And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia Q There 's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it 's being administered by the Russian government SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I think that I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it 's intended for which it 's intended And so we 're going to take great care AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they 're reaching their source I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government Some of these projects especially in democratization and exchanges are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals with businesses The private enterprise support is another example of that SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs one area that we 've been looking at very very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs They would be working very closely of course with the American firms who would be the prime contractors But this is a fine example I think of a more of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level down to the ground in Russia but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended Q When would the democracy corps start Exactly when do you see this happening How would get it off the ground SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Well the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps I think it 's fair to say that we 're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st But in effect we 've already started because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia And we 've said that we will be helpful We 've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts Q Excuse me How much of this 1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I do n't have any figures for you now but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that Q This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions or have we just been that far off the mark SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL No I think unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark and I 'm sorry to say that No this package President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package And he was briefed intensively on this He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package And I think it 's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago We have been refining it ever since We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy And so it 's been evolving But this particular package has been together for about two weeks Q Where is Yeltsin 's input into this then There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsin 's views about specifically what was needed and so forth Is that in the out years SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL No it 's both President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us for instance that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package We listened to him On the privatization effort we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way But let me get at the other part of your question The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake And we 're looking for his ideas The President has brought his own ideas to the table for instance on energy and the environment and in housing But we 're looking for Russian ideas not We need to consult with the Congress and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active Q There 's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL This particular package as I said was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development and so this weekend we 've primarily talked about future about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia which is our base objective here Q I noticed that you that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL You 're right we have a program to train Russian young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States Part of the housing initiative it 's not just to build housing units it 's to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions Q money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL We have not yet allocated any money for that Q Why not Q of the 6 million is going to build 450 housing units Is n't that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL If you want to do housing the right way it 's not just the building the framework of a house you 've got to think about all the utilities You 've got to think about the purchase of land You 've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth And it 's also retraining It 's not enough to put retired an officer coming out of Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well This is responding to a request from the Russian government Q of the 6 million will go to retrain SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL That 's right Q Are you talking about apartment buildings or single SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL We 're talking about single individual dwellings Q You 're saying that only 450 families will be served by this SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL What I want to I thought I pointed out earlier this is a demonstration project What we did n't want to do given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future But we want to do it wisely we want to spend the money wisely Q What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russia 's reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money they 're supposed to pay back especially considering their other debt problem SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Well look I think it 's important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform It 's got to be a collective Western effort and we 're looking to our allies to do more as well But beyond that it 's really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform We can simply play a role and we feel we have an obligation to do so which is consistent with our national interests Q Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States So what is it about this program that does this SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform We are convinced that if reformers stay in power then we 'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia So it 's not a simple question You ca n't just say that this program is the answer It 's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it Q And then on the question of Russia 's ability to repay what convinces you they 'll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL Well the Russian government has made a commitment to repay and what we 're hoping is that if reform continues and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans Q substantial government-to-government loan we 've ever gotten into with the Russians SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I do n't want to answer authoritatively on that I do n't go back 20 or 30 years on this But in the last four or five years yes it is because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans This is a different type of effort Q government loans in any other sector that you recall I know it was n't done in SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL I think it 's fair to say this is a new and unique effort

politics,talk.politics.guns,Very narrow Very very narrow If you 'll recall I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what is n't is only the start of this And you 've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered Reactors blow with a steam explosion but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant See what a can of worms this is Last I heard Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha Nebraska was n't considered a weapon Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years With the PRISM design there is no operator input needed on the reactor itself and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future So your definition is flawed in a few respects already Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed If you do n't mind extrapolation any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus Finally that manure pile I mention below fits this definition as does say releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild And I can show where any such gas has other uses For example perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas It can be used for welding in miners lamps for gassing gophers or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you 'll see that it can also be a weapon just like any other flammable substance So now my miners lamps wo n't work I ca n't do any welding and I still have those pesky gophers The basis for but I 'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law it is in writing a law that can not be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good It is under your proposed law So is a silage pit if there is run-off So are underground fuel tanks It meets all the criterion of a weapon It is an instrument that can be used for fighting even though that is not its intended purpose and despite there being better weapons around Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water mass destruction is rather a given It 's not that certain weapons are n't something I 'd rather not see a lot of people having The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it can not be abused upon some pretext or another The looser your definition the more ripe for abuse that law is Furthermore if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law Again ripe for abuse

politics,talk.politics.misc,Yes sadly this is true The primary reason and the essence of the details that you are seeking is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working In fact they were working so well that unless the feds did something they were going to have to start cutting pork So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush consented to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases As it turned out the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as President so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increases The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office

recreation,rec.sport.hockey,In four of the five games Finns have played the goalie has been chosen the best player of the opposing team In the fifth the finnish goalie Ketterer was elected the best Finn Has this to do with the goalies having good days in these games or are the finnish players just lousy scorers Anyway quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy It looks like the goalies are getting too good Is this due to their equipment getting bigger so they cover more their gloves e.g seem to be much bigger now than they were some years ago Anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way Mikko Wihervaara

including 66.7 hz vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor MacUser Aug 1992 158-176 Older machines that supported color SE/30 II IIX and IIcx had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit color MacUser Special 1993:28-29 To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display capability built-in but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit color Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display QuickDraw QX will change this In addition QuickDraw allows in Macs with a NuBus slot more then one monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures VRAM Video RAM Standard for present non-PowerBook

hardware in question Faisal Nameer Jawdat In addition IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present Matt Healy nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox like Mac 's QD As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly At present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program OS print driver and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode OS and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with an IBM For example one can not edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA 18-bit color palette and DOS 5.0 and still have ALL

Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models SVGA Super VGA This is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a 'catch all category for a group of video cards As such with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme SVGA was chaos with people debating as to what is SVGA and what is not In an effort to make

more then two devises off the SCSI port A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM SCSI-1 7 devices per SCSI controller 8-bit asynchronous ~1.5MB/s ave and synchronous 5MB/s max transfers Difference is due to SCSI-1 software drivers Fast SCSI-1 is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode see SCSI-2 for details SCSI-2 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst 8-bit 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst 16-bit and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst 32-bit/wide and fast Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast SCSI-1 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics but can still use the SCSI-1 ports Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a different SCSI port electronics and software driver from SCSI-1 Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces Mac SCSI asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus Even though Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers the OS SCSI Manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI interfaces As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast asynchronous SCSI-1 Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2 controller chip built-in Digital Review Oct 21 1991 v8 n33 p8 1 though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide SCSI-2 port interface Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2 older NuBus Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU Rumor-some Cyclone Macs June will come with a wide fast SCSI-2 port standard and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager IBM SCSI SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with systems except as add-on EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable Like the Mac 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers out there Unlike the Mac IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI Mac Memory expansion with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs could be used in these Macs only special IIcis could make use of the parity feature By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs The IIfx used 64-pin parity SIMMs The LC III C610/650 and Q800 all use a new 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every memory location if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is Since Macs made before Feb 15 1993 managed memory baced on data path SIMMs had to be installed in pairs 16-bit or in sets of 4 32-bit The Centris 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time If the SIMMs are the same size are used then the memory is 'interleaved across the two SIMMs

present in hardware for programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the OS Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM In addition what little ROM code there is also read into RAM a process called Shadow ROM This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or EPROMS Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches needed In addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a

Mel Park Mac Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment SANE or Standard Apple Numerics Environment Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise Exceptions such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner 1/0 produces the internal representation for infinity INF 1/ 1/0 produces zero The above treatment of 1/ 1/0 occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and the FPU programmed directly IBM Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU 64-bits when emulated The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program On older DOS complilers exceptions could cause program aborts 1/0 and 1/ 1/0 would abort to the DOS prompt at the point where they occured Most present compilers handle this better Result there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS Windows

can be run off of either the printer port to include very old macs or the network port standard today Built-in Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at about 150-

incompatible with the others Once you have chosen one you are pretty much locked-in to that product line from then on Windows/Work Groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem Novell Netware is the biggest ~80 percent of the corporate market and in general is more powerful and offers better control/management/security than AppleShare but it 's also more complex to set up and manage This will change due to the use of the Mac finder and file management system by Novell PC Week 12/14/92 12/28/92 InfoWorld Dec 14/92 MacWeek 3/22/93 Printing Very OS dependent DOS If it 's a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port and do n't worry about it Tweeking may be needed with poorly written software Network Printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one software program to the next Windows 3.x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they are not This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net because there 's no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right now Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like and intelligent about this OS/2 Mac-like the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the OS Printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do not have WYSIWYG printing This is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the OS involved Price issue This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need then Mac and price wars by both worlds The IBM machines modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware

recreation,rec.autos,Is there a Honda mailing list and if so how do I subscribe to it
recreation,rec.autos,It 's been a while since I 've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them Without further delay I will get to the 1993 Audi S4 1 Servotronic steering For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and used in Audis and BMWs I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past couple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd I am quite happy to report now that on the S4 the Servotronic is inoffensive I suppose that due to the fat gumball tires the Servotronic has been loaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation that I have tried It is far from perfect mind you and I 'd be much happier if it was an option that I could refuse but on the S4 I no longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is ruined The steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and I suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver 's hands So there is feel and there is accuracy in the S4 's steering But there is also room for improvement I consider the S4 's steering to be better than the Japanese competition primarily because the Japanese do not believe in feel and engineer it out completely 2 Engine Wheee What a pressure cooker With just 110 miles on the clock I did not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 10000 miles later but still the car packs a terrific punch For a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving i.e low revs high gear It is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there 's only 2.2 liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a fashion With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day which translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph A chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s The technical achievement is breadthtaking Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine In fact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame Downshifts are almost unnecessary It is more fun to use the overboost feature than to rev the engine For those not familiar the S4 engine features up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing Sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a few moments simply by flooring the gas As far as the numbers go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb ft incredible for a 2.2 liter It takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for Since this is quite a heavy car one 's body parts are not flung around like say the Corrado VR6 The acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff Also one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 5 banger Yes Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 2000 The smoothness is outstanding but not quite up to the standards of a very good 6 e.g a 12 valve BMW I 'd say that in terms of refinement i.e willingness to rev smoothness lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s However lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refined The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost Subjectively I 'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 5 Also Audi 's own V8 is also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when pressed though none of these can match its grunt The only hint of the engine 's true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop With the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall Alternately one could use more revs In both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine I think that Audi of America should offer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though in extremely small numbers a 5 speed for the much peakier V8 The characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic Ironically in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again 3 Chassis I 've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16 which is not uncommon at all However the very attractive 5 spoke wheels are no less than 8 inches wide so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever Combined with the flared wheel arches the S4 has a mouth watering macho yet subdued look On rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression I suppose the two are inter-related but I digress To use a cliche the S4 's body feels like it has been carved out of stone Flex is totally undetectable even when going over rough roads With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4 's ride quality will never worry a Lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars The servotronic steering has already been mentioned I consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering I was able to test the car 's cornering powers without too much trepidation I think a new concept is at work in this car With its fat gumball tires talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless On a banked highway on ramp I went in slow and started applying power as I went around I could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways Yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs It felt that the limits were not even close to being approached The g forces were thrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving You tell the car what you want and it does it End of story I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX 's clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too though I 've read that they are prone to fade I am not too surprised since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi 100 fwd Harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold I am starting to see a trend among the luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity The LS400 's fade performance is nothing to brag about neither is the Q45 's or the Legend 's Brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody 's attention is focused on anti-lock capability 4 Comfort For a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are also excellent The cabin is beautifully appointed with carbon-fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4 All the expected gizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power this and that The glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removed because Audi has n't gotten it to work reliably yet That means that the car has no boost gauge A real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance Unusual for the germans the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof as well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch Noise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't consider the Lexus advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer 5 Conclusion Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price of 48K the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem even if it does n't produce Ferrari sounds No other luxury/sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some is worth the extra money all by

religion,soc.religion.christian,"I posted this a couple of weeks ago and it does n't seem to have appeared on the newsgroup and I have n't had a reply from the moderator We were having intermittent problems with our mail at the time Please excuse me if you have seen this before Should Christians fight Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there are such things as justifiable wars I have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as I go I have n't answered all his questions yet and I know what I have here is on a slightly different tack but possibly I 'll be able to get into it more deeply later and post some more info soon Our duty to our neighbour Do good to all men Gal 6:10 Love our neighbour as ourselves Matt 22:39 Act the part of the good Samaritan Luke 10 toward any who may be in trouble We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm even medical corps of the army etc Christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of Israel Ephesians 2:11-12 and also recognise that God rules in the kingdoms of men and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith We are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations so we are just passing through and not part of any nation or any national aspirations this can also be applied to politics etc but that 's another story We are not supposed to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselves to be defrauded it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up God 's kingdom Our duty to the state Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar 's and unto God the things which be God 's Luke 20:25 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers For there is no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God Whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God Rom 13:1-2 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake whether it be to king as supreme for so is the will of God that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men 1 Pet 2:13-15 These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a divine command but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any ordinance of man runs counter to God 's law we must refuse submission to it The reason for this is that we are God 's bond servants and His service is our life 's task An example of the type of thing is in Col 3:22-23 where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the Lord so also we should work as if our boss was God i.e Pressed down shaken together and running over oops a bit of a side track there In the contests between the nations we are on God 's side a side that is not fighting in the battle but is testifying to the truth When we believe in God and embrace His promises we become fellow citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God and are no longer interested in associations of the world Think of this in relation to unions etc as well Paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may run the race that is set before us and if we are wise we will discard any association which would retard our progress Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier 2 Tim 2:3-4 One of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers One of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about God in this case the army The principle comes from Deut 22:10 remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths one was clean and one unclean under the law These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18 I suggest you read this The yoking also has another aspect that of servitude and Jesus says take my yoke upon you so we are then yoked with Christ and can not be yoked with unbelievers We have already seen that we are bondservants of Christ and Paul says become not ye the bondservants of men 1 Cor 7:23 RV An example from the Old Testament the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2 Shouldest thou help the ungodly The situation here is a good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life Here are the facts 1 He had made an affinity with Ahab who had sold himself to work wickedness before the Lord 1 Kings 21:25 2 When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance he had agreed and said I am as thou art my people as thy people 1 Kings 22:4 an unequal yoking 3 He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the Lord trying to do the right thing he found that he was yoked and therefore could n't break away from the evil association he had made God says to us Come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters 2 Cor 6:17 This is more or less what I have found out so far I 'm still looking into it as I do n't think I 've answered all the questions raised by Alastair yet Heres a summary and a few things to think about The Christian in under command Obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with Christ John 15:10,14 Total dedication to this course of action is required Romans 12:1-2 Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his followers 1 Pet 2:7-8 We are to be separated to God Rom 6:4 This involves a master-servant relationship Rom 6:12,16 No man can serve two masters Matt 6:24,13,14 All that is in the 'Kosmos is lust and pride quite opposed to Gos 1 John 2:16 Christs kingdom is not of this world i.e not worldly in nature if it was his servants would fight to deliver him If Christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world then his servants can not possibly fight for another master Strangers and pilgrims have no rights and we can not swear allegiance to anyone but God The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all 2 Tim 2:24 this does not just apply to war but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives There is a war to be waged not with man 's weapons 2 Cor 10:3-4 but with God 's armour Eph6:13-20 I 'll probably post some more when I 've had time to look into things a bit further"

religion,soc.religion.christian,Let me tell you my story I grew up catholic Up until I was 14 it was n't an issue for me Then I met a born-again christian a very sweet person not proseletyzing sp not imposing I tried to get into being as christian as I could as I felt I 'should But the more I tried the more depressed I got I felt guilty for some of my own personal honest feelings I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict until I was 23 Then I taught myself to think rationally I read a lot of books pro and con religion in general and specifically catholicism I came to a crisis point then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist This is a very loose explanation but it 's the gist of it Now at 26 I feel better about myself better self-esteem a generally stronger person I have well-defined goals I have a strong and stable sense of morals and values I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain etc I believe in human rights and 'live and let live among other things I am very anti-violent and anti-hatred This is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved Religion has no place in my system Tough Bertrand Russell said that we can not know god does n't exist we ca n't prove it So in that sense we can only truly be agnostic But for all practical purposes there is no god
religion,soc.religion.christian,Very interesting but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ 's message and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority comes the inevitable fact that some many people will understand it in a distorted way with inevitable consequences The Bible 's message is that we are to love all people and that all people are redeemable It preaches a message of repentance and of giving Unfortunately all people have deceitful hearts and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history I think that you will find many many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already Consider the world without Christianity I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live if it was n't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion I wo n't name any here though one comes to mind which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power greed and hatred Please do n't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial in love for others Yours in Christ Andrew McVeigh p.s I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is strangely enough compatible with becoming a Christian Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world and especially Christians I praise God for Jesus Christ and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven time and time again

computer,comp.sys.mac.hardware,I believe that Apple Sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate power-saving techniques this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future so expect to see it This may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor via a controllable power outlet and power it back on automatically Is this a sell on screen saver software companies Goals for idle power consumption have been set at something like 30 watts for the system not including the monitor do n't quote me on this Note that in many businesses the savings will be substantial especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company Sun itself on the order of 1M per year Putting other and automatic power-saving features in would probably have greater than double that value Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on getting faxes automatically getting email building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut ~2 off the national power consumption based on data I heard

religion,alt.atheism,It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation so as you point out below one must really go back to the original Arabic Regarding the verses relevant to nature I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille 's translations in his book The Bible the Qur'an and Science for in general his translations are more literal Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion Also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator 's interpolation it is not existent in the original Arabic which is why it is included in brackets You 're right what the verses _do_ contain is n't all that remarkable However Dr. Bucaille a surgeon that 's how he 's a Dr. thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century or so And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature I think I remember reading once

Jones at Langley Research Center were giants in the field Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling in the 70s and 50s respectively It 's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds KC-135 and YF-102 but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us The Air Force of course was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s No mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were Mind you the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier but analog Phil Egad I 'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing On the other hand all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base ca n't do

see the evidence for yourself In fact I may post some of it here if it is n't too long I have n't read Lewis 's article so I ca n't comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam His anti-Islamic polemics as I understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths Again read Orientalism by Edward Said I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a well-known book and check the evidence out for _yourself_ If slavery is _in reality_ as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims opposed by Islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too I understand your point of view Selim I think rather it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before Regarding women I have made posting after posting on this subject showing that Islam is not anti-woman etc However have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them I just reposted a very good one under the title Islam and Women reposted from soc.religion.islam If this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article IMHO your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient Regarding slaves _my_ posting on slavery the second one I made which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view Our approaches are different you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths Now just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah No Of course not Let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you The Qur'an prohibits drinking Now if a person says I am a Muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer Of course not and only an idiot would think so Do you see my point You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market for it does in general but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it One can postulate numerous reasons for this Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc Selim I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that Islam lack of education and power For a large part of history the Islamic world was very powerful For a significant section of history the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences So to say that Islam is for example anti-education is completely absurd You try to blame this situation on Islam history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation Well Selim your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in your theory it is by following the Qur'an that Muslims are backwards in education Selim it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory You have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it So far it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this I think Selim you should consider taking your own advice Here too Selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of Islam but also of Islamic history particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history Selim if I remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have

When a message is to be sent it will first be K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver Any method e.g. public key can be used to establish the session key In the AT T telephone security devices which will have the new chip the key is negotiated using a public-key protocol encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E E M K E K UK serial number SK My understanding is that E M K is not encrypted under SK called the family key and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this I will also check it out but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 UK=K1+K2 which will be kept by the two escrow The unit key also called the chip key is generated from the serial number N as follows Let N1 N2 and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys Compute the 64-bit block R1 E D E N1 S1 S2 S1 Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3 I 'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change The fact that they 're called seeds suggests they might Then R1 R2 and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits The first 80 bits form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2 The remaining bits are discarded authorities Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions Please pass them to me along with your reasons In addition to Marty's criteria I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information Some suggestions I 've received so far include SRI Rand Mitre the national labs Sandia LANL Los Alamos Treasury GAO When a court order obtains K1 and K2 and thence K the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link Aside It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the FBI The service provider will isolate the communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through the decode box which will have been keyed with K. for the wiretap authorizations When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank signed forms every time Levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps No single person does at least for FBI taps After completing a mound of paperwork an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the Attorney General for final approval

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Sorry Sherri but I ca n't agree with this particular incident While I 'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples of rampant Hargroving there was a difference here 1 Since time immemorial batters have complained about calls So have pitchers and catchers Usually nothing happens Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints Hirschbeck was acting against expectations 2 It 's not as if Gant was in Hirschbeck 's face Gant said something about the call stepped out of the box and turned away from Hirschbeck As a hitter alibet of little consequence but with a decent eye whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call I 'd want a moment or two out of the box if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch And if I was really angry at the ump I 'd rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed especially at a key moment in the game When Gant turned away Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant to step into the box IMO at this point in time Hirschbeck was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game Gant was n't dawdling he had n't had a chance to dawdle And Hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play Gant resisted as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and Hirschbeck called for the pitch At that point Cox came out on the field the pitch was thrown and many other Braves left the dugout Cox was tossed protecting his player I was pleasantly surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game It 's a small sample size but based on what I saw in that game Mark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play God on the field Not good qualities for an umpire I will keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the future in order to improve my sample size IMO any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Right We 'll probably end up giving them weapons During WWII the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia including via third parties Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press And that's about all we have to go on is n't it And I wish you 'd quit hurling words like racist around There are many levels at which people react to what they see At the most fundamental level you do not have to consciously recognize the racial element you simply tend to empathize more with people who are like yourself As far preferring Christian over Moslem I am an atheist myself and I think you 'll agree that in the US the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of religion nor give it a particularly important place in their world view

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Center for Policy Research writes Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting and racist beyond belief The attempts to quiet any violence in the Gaza Strip are just that The efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came AFTER the violence It was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of Jews Jews had NOT committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza I find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than anti-Israel bigotry It is NOT punishment but protection from repeated attacks by residents of Gaza You self-servingly omit any references to WHY Israel has had to take action Apparaently the deaths of innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation a racist ommission on your part The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law Israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis If this wave of murder does not matter to you then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an anti-Israel charade Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli citizenship and were denied I have heard of no such denials taking place Can you document this or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda The truth is that if Gazan residents applied for citizenship HAMAS would murder them as collaborators Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in How dare you use such a disgusting phrase How very easy you attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism Perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are Do you believe that all Jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you Here 's another little fly in your ointment about the 'master race for you to avoid Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east Four Arab nations refused to grant them asylum Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them they were allowed into Israel Yes Israel But when the plane landed the Israeli Arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project because they felt that it would make Israel look good It was more important to avoid any good PR for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims Israel moved them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure The truth is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back on Muslims in need more than Israel has Even in the case of the 400 deportees Lebanon was willing to let their so-called Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in Lebanon Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait just because they were Palestinian The truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack Israel You are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to attacking Israel But the truth is there are greater reasons than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians To disregard Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews or your hatred of Israel Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism can not be disguised Jews had never declared war on a Polish people Jews had never attacked Poles with knives or had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks To take something like the Warsaw Ghetto the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview You clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement Here is arguably the single most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings Your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation If it were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner rather than in an anti-semitic manner And just how was Gaza obtained Do you forget that Israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had taken Gaza in a war that it did not start Did you know land Israel captures in wars wars which other nations have ALWAYS started are n't the same as Israel and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws Since you do continuously refer to international law would you please say what specific international laws Israel is violating This attitude I can cite reasons why it is not Where is this quote I have never heard Rabin assert that he wished such a thing Since you are in general a liar you'll have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications Only you are led to ask such a loaded racist intellectually dishonest question You inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran or Iraq or Yemen or Saudi Arabia or Syria Do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades Or what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait Or what about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims Do you think the residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims in Bosnia are enduring Why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people Why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated Why do you not care that only Israel has given any of these people safe haven Could it be due to the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing The people in Gaza are not being exterminated They are n't being killed They are n't being raped They are n't being starved They are n't being driven from their lands They are not kept from receiving food or other supplies But the Bosnians are And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking in the guise of compassion Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are Do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you In your case it is clear that hate beats out love every time Maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a Jew It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is being dumped on all other Jews Why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence Maybe these fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period Whatever the case may be it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be When you realize that you ca n't care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good

politics,talk.politics.mideast,Alberto you 've repeatedly misunderstood my postings You are now making the exact point that I 've made several times but with a different definition of religion You do n't not have to believe in the religious aspects of Judaism to be a Jew this would confine Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity. So by converting out of Judaism I do n't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism I mean voluntarily removing yourself from the Jewish nation I am an agnostic but still consider myself Jewish because of my cultural heritage I admit that many religious jews would argue that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith but Judaism is a religion of dissent and debate is n't it The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the least racist and most open nation We have no quotas So I will once again make my point Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion not as you say religious belief is NOT racism You come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism

religion,soc.religion.christian,One interpretation I 've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one 's wife The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her He must honor her as his sister in Christ This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is God 's will for his family without consulting his wife God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife

computer,comp.graphics,FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24 in Orlando Florida The conference was organized by the Rensse- laer Design Research Center in co-operation with IEEE and SIG- GRAPH Attendees came from five countries spanning three con- tinents A good cross-section of the PHIGS community was represented at this conference with participants including PHIGS users workstation vendors third-party PHIGS implementors stan- dards committee members and researchers from industry and academia The opening speaker Dr. Richard Puk challenged PHIGS users to take charge of your PHIGS by participating in PHIGS standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS implementors The closing speaker Dr. Andries Van Dam described his vision of the future of graphics standards beyond PHIGS Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the following topics PHIGS and X Application Toolkits Application Issues Texture Mapping NURBS PHIGS Extensions and Object-Oriented Libraries and Frameworks Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX PHIGS Non-Retained Data Real-World CAD Applications Using PHIGS and Portability Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed a good forum for exchange of ideas needs and experiences The conference also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang- ing from mathematics for 3D graphics to object-oriented tools based on PHIGS Next year 's conference is planned for March 1994 PHIGS EVERYWHERE At the conference PHIGS vendors described and demonstrated PHIGS products that run on all types of computers from PCs to mainframes Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including conditional traversal composite logical input devices texturing and translucency Template Graphics Software launched FIGARO+ PRO the Photo- Realistic Option for PHIGS+ FIGARO+ PRO is designed to add advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API with features like ray tracing materials anti-aliasing and texture mapping Radiosity support is also planned FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly emerging graphics features to their products FIGARO+ supports immediate mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL HP Starbase and SGI GL/OpenGL FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph a powerful 2-call charting system based on PHIGS+ and FIGt an object- oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS on Silicon Graphics workstations Scheduled for summer 1993 Ver- sion 3.0 of GPHIGS the company 's PHIGS+ library for worksta- tions will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS internal state G5G also described their Non-Duplicated Data Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS CSS for more efficient use of memory In addition G5G described their application GSE that allows application callback functions during GPHIGS traversal GPHIGS and PHIGURE G5G 's data visual- izer and application development toolkit are currently available on all major workstations that support GL X Windows PEX or Starbase Wise Software presented a slide show of Z-PHIGS for MS-Windows and ARENA a PHIGS based modeller/render Z-PHIGS implements most of the PHIGS+ primitives In addition Z-PHIGS has built in many advanced rendering features like texture mapping shadow genera- tion area quick updates and ray tracing A demo disk of

religion,soc.religion.christian,This is not true The athiest 's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God As much as some people accept their Church their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the proof this does not satisfy atheists Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are they would be trying to prove 1 1 =2 every time they got up What they dispute is that Churches priests scriptures etc represent true authorities and know the TRUTH Are you asking us to believe blindly You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question Does God exist i.e self-awareness and reason If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth Does God want us to be like that You are right that science and reason can not PROVE anything However if we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone And since we can only use faith why is one picture of God e.g Hinduism any less valid than another e.g Christianity

computer,comp.graphics,Please help I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen While I was working with it this morning the screen started to flicker a little which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and all peripherals It only did this for a second and then stopped I left the room for several minutes and when I returned the screen was completely dim not blank but very very dim The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could faintly make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely no effect I was plugged-in at the time i.e. not using the battery but I still tried switching the battery changing the power-saver features etc. etc. all to no avail Has anyone else experienced anything like this If this just means that I need to replace the screen then I guess I 'll have to but I thought that the death of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened I did n't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they 'll say Yep you got ta have this replaced and it 's gon na cost you I 've only had the computer for about 21 months Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display Oh I guess I ought to give specifics here the brand is Compudyne Is this a reputable company it 's a 386SX 20 MHz I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today If anyone can help me PLEASE give me any advice you might have I 'm not opposed to having it replaced but I 'd rather not if it 's not absolutely necessary If you would n't mind please e-mail me at mike mik.uky.edu but if you 'd rather post I 'll be checking back here in a couple of days BTW if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere feel free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and name of the FAQ if you do n't mind Thanks in advance for any help

science,sci.electronics,Fortunately wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than most at high frequencies Cray computers up to the X-MP at least all had wirewrapped backplanes Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle The 'increase' of wiring capacitance is not really relevant you have to use transmission line techniques and the capacitance is no problem Hand-powered is a terrible choice IMHO unless you are a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections at a time Your hands will cramp Battery-powered wire-wrap guns are available in the 150 range and so are the little twiddle-stick manual types 15 For a modest project of a couple hundred connections I 'd prefer to borrow a professional AC unit or a pneumatic one

science,sci.med,The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new technology for hearing aids The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT T and appears to take a different approach from other aids It appears to me that a new 'programmable aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy situations The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies while the important consonant information unfortunately for me is in the high frequencies The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though I think the phrase is missleading What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge This means that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff Aids with simple compressors do n't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations

science,sci.crypt,Well they ca n't listen in on much of mine since I already use cryptography for much of my electronic mail and will start using it for my telephony as soon as practical However allow me to tell a parable There was once a far away land called Ruritania and in Ruritania there was a strange phenonmenon all the trees that grew in Ruritainia were transparent Now in the days when people had lived in mud huts this had not been a problem but now high-tech wood technology had been developed and in the new age of wood everyone in Ruritania found that their homes were all 100 see through Now until this point no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on someone 's home but the new technology made this tempting This being a civilized country however warrants were required to use binoculars and watch someone in their home The police taking advantage of this would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going on they would use binoculars without a warrant but everyone pretended that this did n't happen One day a smart man invented paint and if you painted your house suddenly the police could n't watch all your actions at will Things would go back to the way they were in the old age completely private Indignant the state decided to try to require that all homes have video cameras installed in every nook and cranny After all they said with this new development crime could run rampant Installing video cameras does n't mean that the police get any new capability they are just keeping the old one A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the lives of the police easy that the police had survived all through the mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will and that Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was expedient was permitted For instance in a neighboring country it had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to solve crimes Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its expedience Indeed why have warrants at all he asked if we are interested only in expedience A famous paint technologist Dorothy Quisling intervened however She noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards and the law was passed Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths while speaking to each other thus preventing the police from reading their lips through the video cameras This had to be prevented the police said After all it was preventing them from conducting their lawful surveilance The wise man pointed out that the police had never before been allowed to listen in on people 's homes but Dorothy Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and mutilation of children No one in the legislature wanted to be accused of being in favor of mutilating children but then again no one wanted to interfere in people 's rights to wear what they liked so a compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras The wise man lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old lip reading technology but it was too late the microphones were installed everwhere However it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent citizens from hiding information from the authorities because some of them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not understand A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at all times only in Ruritanian and for good measure to require that they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones After all Dorothy Quisling pointed out they might be using the opportunity to speak in private to mask terrorist activities Terrorism struck terror into everyone 's hearts and they rejoiced at the brulliance of this new law Meanwhile the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania of which all Ruritanians were proud Why he asked are we obligated to sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police easier There is n't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in crime anyway All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state However the wise man made the mistake of saying this as the law required in Ruritanian clearly and distinctly and near a microphone Soon the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived and took him off and got him to confess by torturing him Torture was after all far more efficient than the old methods and had been recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene thoughts about tomatoes which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the major problems of the new age of plenty and joy Perry Metzger pmetzger shearson.com

science,sci.electronics,Being in the visualization stage of a circuit design right now I was wondering what the best way to scale an AC voltage using an 8-bit digital word is I am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage converted to a sawtooth wave to get a duty cycle However I am leary of this method because it a requires a lot of parts and more importantly b creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line I realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference but that would require more parts and boost the price further Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8 bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip Unfortunately he could n't remember the chip number or the manufacturer if anyone else has heard of this chip please e-mail me I am building this project as a dimmer box for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control well each channel at least Therefor if each box costs 150 I doubt that an end user will want to dish out 150 x 16 2400 for sixteen channels This is something I have noticed about today 's dimmer boxes they are so expensive Anyway any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me always the preferred method will be greatly appreciated

science,sci.med,Robert I 'm so glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion I 've been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci Med I did n't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts just like I have n't read The Yeast Connection Let me just start by stating that the authors of the Cold Fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exile I believe that one has actually left the country Scientific fraud is rare I 'm still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation Your sources do not seem to be research articles They are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combining and life extension texts Robert I try to keep an open mind But some things I just ca n't buy one is taking SOD orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body Your experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove that you are right more ash after seed sprouting than before Unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above 600 degrees I believe you will get organic residue in the ash Even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I could n't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I 'm really guessing at 600 degrees F it may actually be much higher The point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral ash They also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct Chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our soil Are these fusion reactions Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics Do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon Not in my book Robert Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet I 've seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life-form I like reading science fiction as many people do But I know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most cases to separate the fiction from the fact Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans We have several grams of the stuff in our body What 's it doing there Only the Lord knows right now But I will tell you what I do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healing and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue collagen and elastin There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans For bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts A high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation This first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap or gaps between the ends of the broken bone A vitamin C deficiency by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing Zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing And so is silicon in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium For you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick But Robert I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press and yes even some scientific papers Is the explanation reasonable Without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blind you have to take it on faith because you do n't know any better If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base I 'm inclined to consider it this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion If the idea like a candida bloom seems to make sense to me I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I 'm going to give is n't going to really mess somebody up If this makes us kindred souls Robert then I guess I 'll have to live with that label For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert 's interesting post I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV I ca n't remember the network or his name like many nights I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses unconventional treatments his own words He says that he has a 70 success rate The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation conventional treatment He was going to go in and cut You guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals What do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys I 'm going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer like Jon and the chronic GI sufferer like Elaine and tries to help them using unconventional treatments Treatments which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon uses Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are How about quality of life guys May the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut if it does you may feel differently about the issue

science,sci.med,Point 1 I 'm beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whole yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field which I 'm fully cognizant of since I too speak jargonese when with my peers For the situation in sci.med many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large causing significant miscommunication One example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan the flames This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really beat up by non-doctors for their views on medicine which they otherwise do n't see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient Point 2 I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials usually double-blind or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial To these doctors to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice And it follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non- therapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known Anecdotal evidence has no value either from a treatment point-of-view And by and large as a scientist myself I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment However as also being a human being last I checked and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations After all the underlying intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when considering treatment What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidence for patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted and not until then The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license or worse to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am open to alternative therapies as well as why I have real difficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the 99.9 pure scientific approach to medicine I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and by the scientific aspects Anything else is just not good medicine imho Just my 'NF leanings I guess Comments Jon Noring Charter Member INFJ Club

politics,talk.politics.misc,Motor-Voter stuff Well there does have to be a line And to be honest extending voter registration to DMVs is hardly analogous to having only one place for registration in Alaska and opening a new one in Atlanta More is not always better once you 've passed a certain point I thought the Motor Voter bill passed In any case my experiance with Tennessee 's voter registration system which you can register with by mail by the way is that nobody who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to it Once you register it 's good unless you miss for years worth of elections of move It 's easy to register now I simply do n't see the value in going out and trying to get people registered who do n't have enough gumption to even write and have the proper forms sent to them How can we expect responsible decisions out of these people
religion,soc.religion.christian,Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti posted with kind permission of the editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine Morning Star Hope you like it Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti the eldest daughter in the family of seven She was a cheerful girl always imitating her parents She had but one disire but one wish to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord on the feast of Corpus Christi For Maria time seemed like an eter- nity as she slowly neared the great day When it finally arrived Fr Jerome the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and give the children their First Holy Communion delivered a sermon on the immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love we should have in return for Him He then warmly urged them to die rather than commit a mortal sin Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and received the Holy Eucharist Her only sadness was the thought of her father's absence who died some time beforehand As for the rest of the day Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit that is until -4- her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion Thus ended the happiest day of Maria 's life Over the next twelve months Maria had changed from a giggling little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities As her mother went out into the fields in place of her husband Maria took on the ironing cooking washing and other motherly duties She was doing this not only for her own family but also for the Serenellis a father and son who lived with the Goretti 's owning a share in the farm Although Maria was poorer than all the other children she by far surpassed them in virtue In all thi ngs she did the Holy Will of God During the month of June Alessandro Serenelli the son twice made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her On both occasions Maria managed to struggle free of Alessandro's strong grip but on the second he threatened to kill her if she even uttered a word to her mother From this day on Maria lived in terror fearing lest Alessandro attack again On July 5th 1902 Alessandro left work in the fields to get a handkerchief as he claimed He went to the storeroom beneath the house where Maria who was outside on the landing with the baby could hear him fumbling about in with tools She wondered what he was doing It was later learned that he was sharpening a 91/2 blade He went to the house and called for Maria She told him she would n't go to him unless she knew why she was needed He stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room Mar ia instantly realized what he was up to No No No Do not touch me It is a sin you will go to Hell At this point Alessandro held the knife over Maria 's chest who was now on the floor Will you or will you not Maria gathered all her energy No I will not Alessandro no She had chosen her martyrdom over sin God over Satan Overcome with rage Alessandro plunged the knife into Maria 's breast fourteen times Finally he came to his senses and thought Maria was dead Frantically he threw the knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room The crying of the baby Teresa on the landing brought the attention to Assunta and the father of Alessandro As the baby was unattended and was in danger of falling off they ran to the house to find Maria who covered in blood was dragging herself to the door When asked what happened she said Alessandro stabbed her He wanted to make me do wrong and I would not The ambulance arrived then the police who took Alessandro away As the ambulance carried Maria to the hospital a large crowd followed on foot The doctors at the hospital held no hope for poor little Maria The same Fr Jerome who gave Maria her First Communion -5- came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy Viaticum He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer Yes For the love of Jesus I forgive him I wish for him to one day join me in Paradise May God forgive him for I alread y have Maria died at about three o'clock Alessandro was tried and found guilty of Maria 's death but because of his age he was sentenced to only thirty years in prison After eight years of being a violent prisoner and show- ing no regret for his crime he saw in a dream in the midst of a field of flowers Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies to him Soon later he wrote to the local bishop begging God 's par- don for the grave sin he had committed He later gave testimony in Maria 's beatification in 1947 Less than three years later on Ju ne 24th 1950 Maria was canonised Assunta Goretti was the first mother ever to be present at her daughter 's canonisation May St. Maria Goretti help us to be pure and grant us the strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin Saint Maria Goretti pray for us by Brendan Arthur

religion,soc.religion.christian,Good point it is very true that these false predictions are dangerous we are warned more than once in scripture about false prophtets However as is often the case with other issues one can not let those who falsly report such visions as a reason against believing in any of them I did not get the impression you were asserting this by the way I consider my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic as a whole Example The Appearances of Mary at Fatima Portugal in 1917 Among other things she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik revolution She also predicted the second world war that is predicte predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope who was not the current one It happened just like she said She warned there would be fire in the sky as a warning that the second world war was about to start About a week before Germany invaded weathermen and women I suppose all over Europe from England to Spain to Eastern Europe reported the most spectacular reddish color in the sky ever recorded To this day some try to explain it off as the northern lights and the relation to Mary's prediction simply coincidence You all can decide for yourselves Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all over the world and persecute religion She said many other things as well too numerous to list here Every single one has been realized One can only use the term coincidence so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes ridiculous SO yes there are many false prophets and many false reports There are true ones too We must always remain open to that Fatima was one example There is another one currently occuring the apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje Yugoslavia or whatever its called now Mary has been appearing every day for eleven years now It 's time the world started listening

religion,alt.atheism,Deletia in case anybody had n't noticed Frank and I are debating objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics It may be that being a non-native English-speaker I've misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something you do n't assert my apologies I 'm at a loss to imagine what you really do mean though Wrong point The age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity 's sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can have I 'm saying the Universe has a real age because I see evidence for it cosmology astronomy and so on I say this age is independent of people 's opinions of it because I know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results I ca n't see how it does that Put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations see to it s he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be the same Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion If those tests were just my opinion then their own tests which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conducted said tests in identical manner no They do n't which I take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them Map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean physical pain You have a sharp point I 'll give you that but you still have n't given me a way to quantify morality We agree Hypotheses however can change I hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes Better and worse are almost always defined in the context of a moral system Your prediction will _always_ be correct within that moral system What you need now is an objective definition of good and bad I wish you luck Is n't that what _you're_ doing when assuming an objectively real morality Besides what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my statement Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim Besides I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim ponder different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members of society but yet with wildly different moral codes If morality was objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir 'incorrect morality seems to function fine How come As for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick them from different societies say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist deletia testing for footballs on desks One thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason Other times we wish to do something else and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all Some things are hard to make good because we 'd seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into Still the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out I almost always know what good means sometimes I even know why I never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone immutable Yes me too and I 've tried a thing or two down that line it does n't look good for objective values to me at all

science,sci.space,That would not explain why widely separated detectors such as on Ulysses and PVO and Ginga et al. would see a burst at the same time In fact be- fore BATSE having this widely separated Interplanetary Network was the only sure way to locate a random burst With only one detector one can not locate a burst except to say It 's somewhere in the field of view. With two detectors one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky With three detectors one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations If one of these locations is impossible because say the Earth blocked that part of the sky voila you have an error box BATSE by having 8 detectors of its own can do its own location determination but only to within about 3 degrees would someone at GSFC like David like to comment on the current state of location determination Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty You did touch on something that you did n't mean to though Some believe in a reference that I have somewhere that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector It would be a mean nasty God though that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss neutron star but this is getting too far afield

religion,alt.atheism,marshall csugrad.cs.vt.edu Kevin Marshall 1r2eba hsq csugrad.cs.vt.edu Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone which by its nature is without justification That is what I mean by the word faith belief without justification or belief with arbitrary justification or with emotional irrational justification For example when someone says that God exists that they do n't know why they believe God exists they can just feel it that 's faith Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information or increased mental faculty Faith and dogma are irrational The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion If that makes the much overused in this context Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion I can live with that Science is not a religion because there is no faith nor dogma Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists If a philosopher is not an atheist s/he tends to be called a theologian A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred Christianity is a special set of beliefs sanctioned by God himself and therefore to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes Faith comes into play Dogma comes into play The lord works in mysterious ways is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed Sure interpretations of what God said are changed to satisfy the needs of society but when God says something that 's it It was said and that 's that Since God said it it is unflawed even if the interpretations are flawed Science as would be practiced by atheists in contrast has a BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time AND AND AND a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some way The goal is to keep improving the beliefs The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently available That 's the only rational thing to do That 's good philosophy Can you see the difference Science views beliefs as being flawed and new information can be obtained to improve them How many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything None -it would put them out of a job Religion views its beliefs as being perfect and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with them It 's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he does n't require a good rational justification of the killing I do n't consider he 's Jewish or he was born of Jewish parents or this document says he 's Jewish to be good rational justification Clinton and the FBI would love for you to convince them of this It would save the US taxpayer a lot of money if you could

computer,comp.windows.x,2nd posting of the question that just does n't seem to get answered Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics A button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window This action clearly should not call XCopyArea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events e.g window manager-driven exposures take care of rendering the new image Using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped What we need to do is somehow tickle the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item

religion,talk.religion.misc,It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from the FBI and that independent observers i.e the press were not allowed to get close and see things for themselves Official communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue them People in general tend to believe first reports as these get the most and the biggest headlines Corrections are often overlooked An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found in the rubble had bullet wounds The local coroner who is independent of the FBI has so far found no bullet wounds
computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks 3.5 and ideally would like to be able to keep 2 to 4 floppies busy simultaneously on a single PC Yes I know that services to do this exist I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active at a time I know that some controllers are available that can handle 4 floppies with serialized access I know that microchannel machines can keep more than one floppy active simultaneously But does anyone have a controller for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going How about for an EISA machine If the limitation is a software limitation I can work around that by using OS/2 1.3 on my PC-286 New or used I 'm interested orville

religion,alt.atheism,If you 're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well it 's obviously a risk one takes I 'm not an objectivist so I 'm not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience One can get some rough understanding but the language is from the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the perspective of what 's being described rather inexact to be charitable An analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is that the better descriptive language is not available This word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you can show how reliability can be determined
recreation,rec.autos,I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster I take VERY serious offence in your statement I see a lot of computers advertized on the net and my friend just had been releived of his machine all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers Where did you learn logic As for the seats they were replaced by a much harder literally Celica GTS seats due to my back problem That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets and that 's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets
computer,comp.windows.x,We 're looking at various X11 clients for PC 's and we 're looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products Are any notably efficient fast Are any notably inefficient I assume that a Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster right now I 'm looking at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP platform and it 's not surprisingly much slower than ico running on the Sparc10 's console What are the key ways of improving performance for PC presumably Windows clients Also what about async solutions Yes I appreciate that it will be much slower even with V.42bis I 'm in the process of installing PPP with header compression How does that compare to cslip I 've seen a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient but are there comparable products out there If we 're looking for efficiency for async PC clients what should we be looking at in addition to standard PPP w/ compression and XRemote Any information would be greatly appreciated I 'm still taking in all the information in the faq but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great I get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific but that not withstanding any comments would be appreciated Thanks Rob

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Stuff about upated inning scores deleted at just that exact time to see the message even results after the game is over are not necessary thanks to Mr. Hernandez who posts daily standings and results here every day. Am I supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down Just wondering it was meant entirely 100 as a compliment. I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET especially for those in the East Coast who ca n't get final scores for West Coast games in their newspapers or late TV newscasts This is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week Also many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through BBS 's or some pay news services By the way mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions i was not trying to criticize your service at all in fact i was trying to encourage others to use it i do n't personally use it but i 'm sure others do and that was my point in posting there is no need for individuals to duplicate in an ad hoc fashion what you have already organized. if you want to send updates and scores set up a private mailing list and use that. Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec.sport.baseball newsgroup Other than that everything is done through private e-mail Currently there are 986 people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others And the list grows by an average of 35 people a day having one person such as yourself who does it is a great idea having 100 do it is not that 's all keep up the good work Joseph
science,sci.electronics,Well this is my second try at posting on this subject Here goes In Texas Corpus Christi at least if you pick up the phone and dial 890 the phone company will read the number of the phone you are on back to you I believe the service department uses this to make certain they are repairing the correct lines when they open the BIG junction boxes I do n't know if it will work but you can give it a try Good luck

politics,talk.politics.misc,It should be noted that NAMBLA has not been present in the other 600 or so gay parades in the nation While I view this as an isolated event I am very troubled by its reccurence Thank you for correcting the error in my post to the net This information came from a newspaper article that was fuzzy in my mind I can only wonder if there have been similar outcries about NAMBLA 's presence in the parades of New York and Boston Yours in Liberation from Molestation Mark North American Micro-Biological Laboratories Association For a packet containing a sample bulletin publications list and membership information send 1.00 postage to Note Sometimes I do the darndest things while trying to squelch my desire to flame the living daylights out of somebody for their beliefs and/or associations especially if they are so genial Phil take it away
religion,talk.religion.misc,If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by experiment and observation then I would agree with you Chris The burden of proof would belong to Bill But the source document for Christianity the Bible simply assumes God exists and makes it clear to us Calvinists anyway that when a person is in fellowship with God it is because God has taken the initiative in revealing Himself to that person So from a Christian point of view the burden of proof belongs to God Bill is being consistent with what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming convinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God Please excuse me if I missed an earlier part of this thread in which Bill came across like an egotist What I saw was simply obedience to the scriptural command to always be ready to give a reason for the joy that is in you

computer,comp.windows.x,Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets These are good tools but they are 1 heavy 2 hard to find when you need one 3 limited in their software expandibility 4 difficult to use to upload data for analysis 5 can not be remotely operated and 6 can not resolve names with DNS requiring much manual manipulation of the name table We also sometimes use tcpdump but we found it 1 too difficult for most people 2 did not have enough information for many protocols 3 could not be used interactively 4 could not handle TCP streams and 5 could not read Sniffer files However tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively It should work on the same systems as tcpdump It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better The following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking tcpview-1.0.tar.Z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries What tcpview adds to tcpdump easier interface enhanced protocol decoding hex display of frame capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer 's name ethernet address host table can easily follow a stream highlighting out-of-order frames can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional processing CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1 New features Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files When used with the file type will be automatically detected Can now read in and use an SNMP MIB file The hex format has been changed New time options have been added Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers -S flag New flags -R read Sniffer file Not usually needed except for reading from stdin -ttt prints delta times -tttt prints times relative to the first frame -W write a Sniffer save file use with -w -x print frame minus link-level header in hexdump format Sample output 16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 nic.funet.fi.ftp S 0:0 0 win 16384 0000 45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02 E _p 0010 80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00 d .J 0020 50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 P. .N -X print TCP data in hexdump format used with -Z -z write TCP data to stdout use with -t to eliminate timestamp -Z write frames and TCP data to stdout Martin M.

religion,talk.religion.misc,As opposed to Universal or Catholic or FourSquare Gosple I think that the Greek Orthodox Church would take high offense at your misuse of the word Your version of Christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived you make claims of bible-centricity that are not derivable soley from the Bible About six-seven months ago you claimed that your primary objection to the LDS was that our doctrine was not bible-derived And now this and other claims can be shown are also not bible interpeting bible Simple truths oh for example paradise exalted to heaven paradise was n't equal to heaven and _now_ it is Yet you claim that peeple can not be exalted to heaven nicht wahr When I read the story I found that Abraham 's Bosom was n't so much a place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to Abraham Gee this is fairly close to what the LDS call spirit prison and what you have called false doctrine vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the SunSpot Gopher Archive This part is _not_ supported from scripture nor does it support your claim that the paradise where Christ descended was exalted Making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the scripture Using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison is now changed from a Pre-Easter postion to post-easter by God postion is not supportable Makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here Yes and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading of the scriptures You have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural proof need to be cross-checked The referencs that you supply often do not support your postion if they are read in the context of the scripture How about that those who have been in paradise and have accepted the gosple will be judged of Jesus Christ and then return to the presence of God Is that somehow different from your expressed view that the paradise spoken of or Abraham 's Bosom Should we go back and discuss your view on why the Angle of the Lord is the Lord again

science,sci.space,I was at an interesting seminar at work UK 's R.A.L Space Science Dept on this subject specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project I 'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting Here goes The Microlight Solar Sail 1 Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept Harnessing the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range In principle such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional type spacecraft is a daunting task This is why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft has actually been launched to date 2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics with no mechanical parts Several attitude control methods are feasible for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself Launched as a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars 3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions For example a It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate b It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base BTW c It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus Impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube like performing a biopsy Returning to Earth the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature can not exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered enclosed in a small insulating container Contact Colin Jack Tel 0865-200447 Oxford Mathematical Designs 131 High Street Oxford OX1 4DH England This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or seeking details or anything and would be most happy to send you more information Andy

religion,soc.religion.christian,Subject hate the sin Date 12 May 93 08:27:08 GMT Hate the sin but love the sinner I 've heard that quite a bit recently My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not Hate begets more hate never love If you are questioning whether or not hating sin is consistent with Christianity I ask you to consider the following Scripture Romans 12:9 Let Love be without hypocrisy Hate what is evil cling to what is good What is it that Paul through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is calling us to hate Would God call us to do something that would eventually lead to hating our fellow man especially when he commands us to do the opposite to love your fellow man Consider some sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner That has not been my experience I 've not found myself hating anybody as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life As a sinner myself I find myself having more compassion for the person Jesus too since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are is able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall Jesus is our very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner In the account of the woman caught in adultery John 8 Jesus had compassion on the woman BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin This is what it means to love sinners but hate their sin it means loving them unconditionally while at the same time calling them to leave their sin In addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the Christian I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it It was not unloving for the Christian to call me out of sin in fact I believe it was the most loving thing that that person could have done He loved me enough to want to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin After enough of this the sinner begins to hate us they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their behavior Hate builds up and drives people away from God this certainly can not be a good way to build love Again I do n't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of the Christian If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners exemplified in John 8 and the sinner hates us for it then we have done the best we can We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and they will have rejected it Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner then indeed we will ourselves be in sin In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our neighbors He does n't say anything about hate I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New Testament I really think that you will be surprised In fact if anything he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent Hope this helps In Christ Tony Balsamo

It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents with dvips Or just tell me another free program that converts one of the supported formats to ps It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size scrollable I know of several such programs idraw xfig tgif I have no experience with any of them Features I would like in the programs are ability to draw circles arcs straight lines boxes and arrows support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects support for texts in any size ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component e.g a transistor symbol composed of three lines an arrow and a circle any aid numeric coordinates screen grid to align parts of the drawing less essential but in fact very handy preservation of connection If I move one part of the drawing the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing stay connected Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics flow charts logic diagrams data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my whishlist and are there any other programs How demanding are the programs with respect to disk space memory and CPU usage Are any of the programs known to work on Linux with monochrome X

religion,soc.religion.christian,So true I 'm not sure of the basis of the belief but it was a widely held belief among the laity of the RC church and their support of it lead to it being declared to be true Basically the teaching on infallibility holds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine the college of bishops is likewise infallible and the laity is as well The pope gets most of the attention/criticism but the consensus of the other bodies is equally infallible according to RC teaching
religion,talk.religion.misc,Rick Anderson replied to my letter with ra In article C5ELp2.L0C acsu.buffalo.edu ra Just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing You refer to differing interpretations of create and say that many Christians may not agree So what That is really irrelevant We do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we The bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of opinions It may be irrelevant to you and your personal beliefs or should I say bias but it is relevant to me and many others You 're right the bottom line IS truth independant from you or anyone else Since you proclaim truths as a self-proclaimed appointee may I ask you by what authority you do this Because it says so in the Bible Does the Bible say so or is it YOU or someone else who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapproval Excuse moi but your line of truths have n't moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous Of all the preachers of truth on this net you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking crew with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint BTW this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrite s ye preach about me with your lips but your hearts are far removed from me Also I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the Mormon belief You ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed In order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant Sophistry Look who 's talking jumping to conclusions You would n't do that yourself right All YOU address is your own convictions regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever The Bible states that Lucifer was created The Bible states that Jesus is the creator of all The contradiction that we have is that the LDS belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine The former KGB would have loved to employ you Jesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know it The Mormon belief is that all are children of God Literally There is nothing symbolic about it This however contradicts what the Bible says The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God Correction it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in His footsteps Satan and his followers have rebelled against God and are not children =followers/redeemed of God but it does n't mean that they were not once created by God but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation The field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one Matthew 13:38 kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus and have shown works of repentance etc and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb The issue of satan 's spirit-origin and of those who followed him has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible You purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non- related scriptures lots of nice scriptures deleted NOT Robert W. copyrighted though ra We are told that And this is life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent ra John 17:3 Life eternal is to know the only true God Yet the ra doctrines of the LDS that I have mentioned portray a vastly ra different Jesus a Jesus that can not be reconciled with the Jesus of ra the Bible They are so far removed from each other that to proclaim Correction my Jesus is indeed different than your Jesus and CAN be reconciled with the Jesus in the Bible Not your interpretation of Him I concur but I honestly could n't care less ra one as being true denies the other from being true According to the ra Bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true God and ra not the construct of imagination In this single posting of yours I 've seen more constructs of imagination than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about the only true God whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes but whose image I can not reconcile with what I know about Him myself I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ but in a different way or fashion than your own Not that it really matters the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear This is really a red herring It does n't address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate The fact that some groups try to read something into the Bible does n't change what the Bible teaches Sigh What the Bible teaches Or what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co. I respect the former I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus On the contrary And by the way I do respect your interpretations of the Bible I even grant you being a Christian following your own image of Him as much as I am a Christian following my own image of Him in my heart Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine I don't think that it matters if McConkie 's views were canon That is not the issue Were McConkie 's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this subject is the real issue The indication from Rick is that they may certainly be The issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church The issue of official doctrine is obviously very important McConkie 's views have been controversial e.g The Seven Deadly Heresies has made me a heretic at best or erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations his book Mormon Doctrine is oftentimes referred to as McConkie 's Bible in mormon circles on mormon doctrine I rather look to official doctrinal sources and to Hugh Nibley 's books The last comment is an lds-insider reference Summarizing McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation But having said this I find McConkie even in his most biased and speculative moments far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen I 'm somewhat appalled that I have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting Robert Weiss psyrobtw ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

politics,talk.politics.mideast,"And this is just the beginning Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government will not get away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds and 204,000 Azeri people Your criminal grandparents committed unheard-of crimes resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism organized massacres poured petrol over babies and burned them raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate And today they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history Your fascist grandparents admitted their unspeakable crimes then Why deny them now Now the genocide of the truth by the criminal/Nazi Armenians Not a chance Source Men Are Like That by Leonard Ramsden Hartill The Bobbs-Merrill Company Indianapolis 1926 305 pages Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people Foreword For example we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque the most habitable building of a destroyed village near the border of Persia and Russian Armenia During the course of evening I asked Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction In his matter of fact way he replied Yes I assisted in its sack and destruction and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins p. 202 first and second paragraphs We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead p. 15 second paragraph The Tartars were for the most part poor Some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers They drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons They ranged from the salt desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains Even the village Tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars and while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and treated them as inferiors The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility p. 20 second paragraph Our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear Our men hammered on the doors but got no response whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain Throughout the hideous night I cowered at home in terror unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men By morning the work was finished p. 109 second paragraph As things were the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law When they became a legally instituted recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days The outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was as in the old days trial and execution without hearing A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him The method of execution was for a government 'mauserist to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts p. 203 first paragraph A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back Another soldier seized a rock and pounded the Tartar 's head with it The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the Tartar 's body and raising it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in Russian 'Slodkey Slodkey Sweet p. 203 second paragraph One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village Among the ruins a fire was burning I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers Among them were two Tartar girls mere children The girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed sobs Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes There were also bodies of the dead p. 204 first paragraph I was soon asleep In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child I arose and went to investigate A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted Guided by the child 's crying I entered the yard of a house which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead Her throat had been cut Lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a year old p. 118 Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart jolting and the loads swaying Boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks In the carts the women veiled as is the Tartar way held children in their arms Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold A few old men plodded along on foot Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted The gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety This massacre was not complete The Armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed p. 192 Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks p. 193 Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars Kurds and Turks Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country p. 195 The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity Tartars Kurds and Russians p. 218 First and second paragraphs Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages We Armenians did not spare the Tartars If persisted in the slaughtering of prisoners the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands and exchanging blow for blow They had died as the helpless must with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself p. 133 first paragraph In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death I was sickened by the brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest Some mercifully were shot Many of them were burned to death The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after crowding the hut with Turks set fire to the straw p. 19 first paragraph The Tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of ruins It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered The same fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi p. 22 second paragraph Many of our men had served in the Russian Army and were trained soldiers We Armenians were rich and possessed arms Tartars had never received military training They were poor and possessed few arms beyond knives Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village the revolution in Russia was suppressed p. 97 third paragraph Within a few years following the beginning of the movement an invisible government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government This secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'Mauserists professional killers to enforce its decrees p. 98 first paragraph The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish Government p. 98 third paragraph the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene and secure independence for Turkish Armenia p. 99 second paragraph The Dashnacks were fanatics p. 99 third paragraph The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the Russian province They instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians A wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum Refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question If a man were to be assassinated lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists of the party p. 130 first paragraph in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars they Armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance p. 130 third paragraph The city was a scene of confusion and terror During the early days of the war when the Russian troops invaded Turkey large numbers of the Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian advance p. 159 second paragraph I made a cannon a huge gun to lift which required four men I made balls for it With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out p. 181 first paragraph The Tartar villages were in ruins p. 189 third paragraph The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned Serdar Argic"

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP I go to school in Philadelphia and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent Morning show In my opinion I think Imus is much better than Bruno Cataldi and Morganti even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with To me WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme In terms of sports Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his show 10 AM to 12 Noon I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host 12 Noon to 2 PM At this point I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks I just think JM has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the Philadelphia fan base This is most evident when the IGGLES Philadelphia spelling play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts re WIP morning 'guys I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin If you are in NY and you ca n't get WIP JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes 2PM to 4PM This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo fatso and froot loops and I become the most divided in my loyalties Mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the 10 to 12 debate Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning which are often hilarious 4 PM to 7 PM MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli I like Mike Missanelli but I just ca n't stomach Steve Fredericks I know that SF came from Philly originally but when he was at the FAN he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now I do n't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the reason That is why I give the advantage to FAN 7 PM to Midnight S M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism G Cobb This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts I know that is biased but listen to his show On FAN there is usually a game on Knicks Rangers Mets Jets or St. John 's basketball If the game is on the west coast then it is usually Howie Rose Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season If this is the sports station why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP home of Howard Stern in Phil During the summer it is all talk on WIP Overall I would have to give the advantage to WFAN with the exception of 10 to 12 and 2 to 4 where it is even and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage Rich

religion,alt.atheism,Anton LaVey 's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me I read his Satanic Bible a few years ago for a social studies project as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called The Cult of Devil Worship in America The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self When I refer to Satanism I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan I do n't consider LaVey 's church to be at all orthodox nor do I consider its followers satanists LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche Crowley and Reich slapped in some religious doctrine added a little touch of P.T Barnum and christened his creation the Church of Satan No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex At any rate it worked for a while In its heyday the Church had a huge following including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis Jr. and Jayne Mansfield I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy by the way I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ But if you include the Church of Satan then I suppose I need to alter my definition Webster 's Dictionary and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same

religion,alt.atheism,I do n't think I 've changed my stance at all My original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel one I did n't say what would be considered cruel only that a painless death was n't Now cruelty must involve some sort of suffering I believe I do n't think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much Even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain but it 's over so quickly Pardon No Well again I stated that a painless death is n't cruel but I don't think I stated that all painful executions are cruel I think that some are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the pain Anything more than an instant I guess Any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think this includes the gas chamber and drawing and quartering I 'd say that any pain that lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long but this may be an arbitrary cutoff I suppose

religion,soc.religion.christian,I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then but I would like to relate an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October The dear old aunt now deceased was very proud of her Jewish heritage although not especially devout Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish While conversing with her about politics world affairs and religion she remarked that it would be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta Within two days of returning to Atlanta her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband I went not knowing really what to expect other than stimulating conversation and fellowship What I got however was rather unexpected The thrust of the evening 's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded family planning clinics prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico on the ban on fetal tissue research and against the Mexico City policy which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of overpopulation rampant domestic crime African starvation unwed mothers etc. on Christianity rather on the fall of Adam Now this is not what I had to come to talk about But every time I tried to bring up the subject of Judaism they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism because it involves too much study and effort And I did not even raise the prospect nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there And again last November I toured a traditional Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general I realize that these are two isolated incidents and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish but from my experience the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism boundary

Clark Oxford 1933 reprinted 1970 This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic I do n't know if it actually contains an english translation or not 3 Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in Acts Eldon J Epp Cambridge 1966 4 The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early '80s I can supply the reference if anyone 's interested 5 Now many of the works are going to be difficult to find So if you 're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent and easily obtainable discussion can be found in A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT Bruce Metzger United Bible Society 1971 Metzger 's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3 Furthermore notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT the majority of these occur in Acts An attempt was made to set before the reader a more or less full report with an English translation of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings p 272 6 Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus adher pretty closely to the shorter or Alexandrian version The longer version to which you refer is usually called the Western version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources 7 As far as size the difference is that in Clark 's edition mentioned above the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort a typical Alexandrian text contains 18,401 words i.e a difference of about 8-1/2 8 To answer the obvious questions no there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text The main difference seems to expansion of detail in the Western text or if you prefer contractions in the Alexandrian The Western text seems to be given to more detail There are some interesting specific cases but this probably not the place to go into it in detail 9 The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is i that neither text represents purely the authentic version ii each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however iii the variant in the Alexandrian text is the better more often than not"

science,sci.crypt,I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act on the export of cryptographic technology however is it illegal to transmit encrypted data from the U.S. to another country If so then which laws apply to this situation From the US law perspective unless you 're engaging in illegal speech it 's not illegal to use encryption Yet The NSA is allowed to try to listen but you 're not obligated to make it easy for them Yet The other country may have more repressive laws about that I gather France 's bureaucracy wants to know what you 're saying and in the old Soviet Union they did n't need laws to make things illegal paranoia follows for those of you who want to play it safe The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use wimpy crypto technologies but it may also affect your willingness to use technologies that violate RSA 's patents e.g if you use PGP the NSA may tell RSA that you 're doing so and if the Secret Service catches on they may decide that the mere fact that RSA has n't filed a lawsuit against you does n't mean that you do n't deserve to have your computer confiscated for possible patent violation munitions law violation espionage money laundering drug importation and creatin a disturbance and then not give it back because you did violate the patent even though they had to drop all the other charges unlike that nasty Steve Jackson who had the gall not to be guilty of anything

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,They do n't have a conflict because technically LPT1 does not use IRQ7 The Parallel printer processor the actual number escapes me contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7 then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it 's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F 's will be sourced from the printer controller chip thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7 Note this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus although COM 's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused

science,sci.space,Book Review THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION by Dewey B. Larson 1984 North Pacific Publishers Portland Oregon 456 pages indexed hardcover THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical mysteries This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged edition of THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE 1959 Volume I is NOTHING BUT MOTION 1979 and Volume II is THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER 1988 Most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial differentials and other FANCY MATHEMATICS In this book by contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual validity Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University He developed the Theory described in his books while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements they contain THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION describes the astrophysical portions of Larson 's CONSISTENT INTEGRATED COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe a kind of grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for It is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component MOTION existing in THREE dimensions in DISCRETE units and with two RECIPROCAL aspects SPACE and TIME 2 The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics its primary magnitudes are ABSOLUTE and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN From these two postulates Larson was able to build a COMPLETE theoretical universe from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with translational vibrational rotational and rotational- vibrational motions At each step in the development he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe including EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED For example in his 1959 book he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory And when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation ready for those also As a result of his theory which he called THE RECIPROCAL SYSTEM Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter quantum wave mechanics as applied to atomic structure nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass increases relativistic Doppler shifts nuclear fusion in stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES He was very critical of the AD HOC assumptions uncertainty principles solutions in principle no other way declarations etc. used to maintain them THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION is divided into 31 chapters It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe Galaxy formation from the MYTHICAL big bang is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers He then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of SINGLE stars Several chapters are devoted to quasars which according to Larson are densely-packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find Larson 's explanations quite valuable if considered with an OPEN MIND For example they used to believe that GAMMA RAY BURSTS originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy But the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any visible objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence Larson 's explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe which Larson calls the cosmic sector Because the anti-matter universe exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe with the speed of light as the BOUNDARY between them and has THREE dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space the bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly at random Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books journal articles and leading physicists and astronomers In this book 351 of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book For example a quote from the book Astronomy The Cosmic Journey by William K. Hartmann says Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars form Unfortunately we can not Larson 's book contains LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists astronomers and astrophysicists For more information answers to your questions etc. please consult my CITED SOURCES Larson 's BOOKS UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED

science,sci.space,In some sense I think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful and the folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are both right That is I think that space advertising is an interesting idea and if someone wants to try it out more power to them However a company may discover that the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising and a company who gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would gain might decide to bow out of the project I got incensed when I read that Carl Sagan called this idea an abomination I do n't think that word means what he thinks it does Children starving in the richest country in the world is an abomination an ad agency is at worst just in poor taste

religion,soc.religion.christian,I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style values-free methods that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make choices actually _increase_ pregnancy rates I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate The difference is not in contraceptive technology but in the values taught to the children The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired Question for further discussion as they say in the textbooks Why don't we teach safe drug use to kids instead of drug abstinence Is n't it because we know that a class in how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs would increase drug use Why is n't drug abstinence education barred from schools because it teaches religion Are n't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway and need instruction in their safe use

politics,talk.politics.mideast,From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Zionists reject non-Jews News Ethiopian Jews and not-quite Jews The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to Israel who are dying of starvation The following are excerpts from an interview with the former general director of the JDC project for development and welfare of Ethiopian Jews Kobi Friedman Hadashot 21 April 1993 who has stated that there are people dying in Addis Ababa but they are converts to Christianity Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa How do you know that they are actually converts to Chritianity If there are Jews on the tape then I do n't know what to say I am speaking from experience when I say that those who remained in Ethiopia are Christians I know that there have previously been things published in the press by interesting parties and there is no connection between them and reality What interested parties Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives to come here What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel do when their parents and the rest of their relatives remain in Ethiopia I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia Well my answer is that it is not It would be a better solution economically as well for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to Ethiopia and reunite with his family there

recreation,rec.sport.hockey,As the Sharks season came to a close tonight I will start a series of posts trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc. that went through for the Sharks for the past season If you are uninterested since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings you can kill them I will first try to evaluate how the players did These ratings of course are subject to my own biases but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and/or did not play for another NHL team this season Thus then let 's go to the goaltenders 1 BRIAN HAYWARD Season 11th Acquired '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade P D It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies with Patrick Roy in '87 '88 and '89 It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade and skip the letter grading but he had simply been awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie But Hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the Sharks first ever victory the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames As he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was 30 JEFF HACKETT Season 3rd Acquired '91-92 from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft Grade C Hackett after deservedly winning the team MVP honors last season simply wasted the year Other than a few good spots 57 saves against Los Angeles almost-shutout against Tampa Bay etc Hackett finishing with 85.6 save percentage and a 5.28 GAA watched his status go from the team 's 1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season He was expected early to carry the team along instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor but upon return he simply was n't up to the task He may not return next year 31 WADE FLAHERTY Season 1st still eligible as rookie Acquired '91-92 signed as undrafted free agent Grade I A- It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get against the Calgary Flames Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods He started the season poorly in Kansas City but finished strong prompting the Blades' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL last year he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs picking up all-star honors along with Irbe now it 's time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year because with prospects Dan Ryder Trevor Robins and Scott Cashman coming along if he does n't make it next year he may not ever 32 ARTURS IRBE Season 1st Acquired '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade B+ I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he 's a bona fide NHL goaltender perhaps a bona fide 1 goaltender He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had getting the team 's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26 He has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and making passes reminding people of a young Ron Hextall except of course the goonism Yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season Irbe 's the key as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts

religion,soc.religion.christian,ACT 5:40 41 The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text Luke 's account is highly suspect I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts Moreover Luke 's account is written at least 90 years after the fact In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established Moreover Pauls account of some of the events in Acts as recorded in Galatians fail to establish the acts accounts What we need therefore is a reliable text critically appreciated which documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection I would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians I think you will be disapointed

religion,talk.religion.misc,I hope I did n't award custody Rich I purposely used handle in order to avoid doing so i.e. that happens to be what religions do of course there are aberrations like scientific creationism I used best in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who so these domains are mostly ignored I also attempted to be brief which no doubt confused the matter As an aside for science I should have written how and when Nobody seems to argue over what Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual I 'm not trying to be evasive on this but from a societal perspective religion works On the other hand sometimes it is abused and misused and many suffer which you know But the net result seems positive this from the anthropological perspective on human affairs You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I think the masses ca n't get along without religion Not that generally they are incapable they just do n't and for myriad reasons but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality Very seductive that immortality Therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to who and why I suggest that this holds regardless of the truth in their answers to who and why simply because people believe In the end spiritual beliefs are just as real as scientific facts and explanation CAUTION TO SOME DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT No In fact I do n't think it is closed now at least for some individuals Is n't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity This approach might presuppose an absence of who and why except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing Maybe that something doesn't have to be supernatural maybe just mechanistic But that 's a tough one for people today to grasp In any case theory without empirical data is not explanation but then your question does not require data In other words I agree that theorizing within scientific parameters is just as scientific as explaining So the answer is who and why are not closed to scientists but I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate Data will be necessary for improvement and that seems a long way off if ever Pretty convoluted here I hope I 've made sense I agree generally But I prefer to put it this way the questions of how when who and why were not open to inquiry During the Enlightenment reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when and not for the most part who and why Science was thus born out of the naturalists curiosity eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why The ignorant the selfish the intolerant and the arrogant of course still claim authority in all four domains Much obliged Funny how facts tend to muddle things is n't it Well I am sure there are plenty of scientific creationist rebuttals out there somewhere even if they have to be created from nothing just for the record again AMH anatomically modern humans Best regards

to fund This sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated Think about that Of the 30 billion cost of Freedom fully 10 billion wo n't be spent on anything having anything to do with Space Stations Now maybe that 10 billion was wisely spent and maybe it was n't but the work done with it should stand on its own merits not distorting the cost of other projects Congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps Congress has never heard the term 'center tax They look at the Station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it does n't add up They wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else My dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here A couple of weeks ago when I first read this in your posting I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters if you wondering why I did n't post a response immediately I do have a real job I 'm supposed to be doing here at Headquarters digging up old 20 kHz data looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority Also I spent last weekend in Kansas City at the National Science Teachers Association conference extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers First off yes the concept of 'center tax or 'wrap does exist If I recall the numbers correctly the total 'tax' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around 40 Million This was computed by adding up the WP-1 WP-2 and WP-4 center 'taxes With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at 2.2 Billion my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 1.8 Over the life of the SSF program using your figure of 30 billion for the cost of SSF a tax at a 1.8 rate comes to 540 million This is alot less than 10 billion but I will concede it 's still an appreciable amount of pocket change I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center kind of like McDonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you do n't if you get it take-out For example at WP-4 the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract and are NOT subject to the center tax I do n't have the numbers in front of me but I 'd guess at least 95 of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne So you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3 but it 's only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts This leads to the obvious question What is the government doing with SSF funds that do n't go to the prime contractors i.e ok WP-4 gets a slice of the 30 billion pie A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne What happens to the balance of the funds which are n't eaten up by the center tax At WP-4 we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne We have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture Our testbed has a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few years back with lead-acid car batteries to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF DC switchgear DC-DC converter units and simulated loads Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana As a side point 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year As a final example my 'home division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements Finally the money raised by the 'tax does not all go into a 'slush fund At Lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund Each year any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter Most of the tax however goes to fund the 'general' services at the Center like the library the central computer services division the Contractor who removes the snow etc Thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget does n't go for SSF activities To get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is 'billable to SSF would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library Who knows maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal Talk about a burecratic nightmare"
science,sci.med,The following is from a critique of a 60 Minutes presentation on MSG which was aired on November 3rd 1991 The critique comes from THE TUFTS DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER February 1992 edited for brevity Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes last November 3rd 1991 you came away feeling MSG is bad for you In the segment entitled 'No MSG for instance show host Ed Bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them 'millions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violently sick peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal testimony and speaks of studies on MSG that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order to back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that MSG a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items causes headaches What he does NOT make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on rabbits One of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologist Patricia Williams Ph.D. says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get headaches from it 'But she explains 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney a professor at the Washington University School of Medicine who Mr. Bradley remarks 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters because it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage Dr. Olney's research with lab animals does not 'show anything about human youngsters In fact only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney 's experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injected extremely high doses of MSG into rodents completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty stomach Of course neither of those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in MSG with food And most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very little reaches the bloodstream much to little in fact for human blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in Dr. Olney 's lab animals The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of that fact And so does the European Communities Scientific Committee for Food Both after examining numerous studies have concluded that MSG is safe Their determination makes sense considering that MSG has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and a burning sensation among others In fact the most fail-safe of clinical studies the double-blind study has consistently exonerated the much-maligned substance That 's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains protein The reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is broken down into glutamate during digestion It 's a breakdown that occurs frequently Glutamic acid is the most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet It makes up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods 20 percent in milk 25 percent in corn and 29 percent in whole wheat That does n't mean it 's entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore sensitive to it The consensus reached by large international professional organizations is that MSG is safe the same consensus reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large

April 1980 IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER From time to time claims are made that chemicals released from the Space Shuttle 's Solid Rocket Boosters SRBs are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer Studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study Charles Jackman The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by Dr. Michael Prather NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia NASA/GISS Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc. The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine Industrial sources kilograms/year Natural sources kilograms/year Shuttle sources 725,000 kilograms/year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly Thus the launches would add less than 0.25 to the total stratospheric chlorine sources The effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0.0065 This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible The launch schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space Shuttle 's Impact on the Stratosphere_ MJ Prather MM Garcia AR Douglass CH Jackman M.K.W Ko and N.D.

politics,talk.politics.mideast,I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles This Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism yet because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion you attack him Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's question in an intelligent and unoffending manner The only ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact are the Israelophiles Now will we please start having some INTELLIGENT conversation You all are an insult to you race assuming you are also semitic Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism during the 1930 's and 1940 's The Hirgun and other branch off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of Palestine Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the Arabs These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British soldiers but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in favor of a compromise with the Palestinians In addition they massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948 contributing to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their very lives I mention this not because I 'm anti semitic I 'm part Jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the Israelites pisses me off so I 'm not as critical of the Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the Jews It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for German and European anti semitism

politics,talk.politics.mideast,I believe that things are getting mixed here Critizicing Israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing the absolute negatives of that culture Maybe because a person can see the positives of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the State of Israel I for one consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to the human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty opposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of respect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion segregation and years in the diaspora He might not want to recognize that It does not make him a self-hating Jew as far as I see it At most he is a person who is not telling the truth But so far it seems that the blame is always put on the other If you read this newsgroup for example Israel is never guilty by herself She is always responding to the actions of the other and it goes as if the actions of Isreal do not also affect the response of the other in a cycle that never ends Also there is blindness to try to understand what the other feels and why There is always and excuse There is always a rationale to explain why things happen as they do And what is the worst part for me there seems to be all the time an intention to try to de-humanize the other as if the other did not care about their future children peace etc etc

religion,soc.religion.christian,He does n't contradict himself The church is to last for all time However there are those who use the church to bolster themselves This is evident in many letters For instance Paul talks about the super-apostles to the Corinthians 2 Corinthians 11-12 he mentions how people will be led away by miracles signs and wonders 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies 1 Timothy 4:1-3 and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear 2 Timothy 4:3-4 Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them Matthew 24:4-14 But look at the promise in this last part Verse 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come Even today there are false teachings I can name two which I am well familiar with the non-need of baptism and the praying of Jesus into your life for salvation Both are taught Both are DEAD wrong They have been taken out of context from some verses interpreted from others and just plain made up The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33 He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20 The church Jesus founded though is alive and well It 's not being persecuted as much as back then the laws wo n't allow it yet but it is being persecuted Joe Fisher

religion,alt.atheism,deleted think deleted Let me first say that to believe that no gods exist is in fact different than not believing in a god or gods I will argue that your latter statement I believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith that is if you are making a POSITIVE statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying I do n't know and therefore do n't believe in them and do n't NOT believe in then weak atheism Once again to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist I still maintain the position even after reading the FAQs that strong atheism requires faith But first let me say the following We might have a language problem here in regards to faith and existence I as a Christian maintain that God does not exist To exist means to have being in space and time God does not HAVE being God IS Being Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist He is eternal With this said I feel it 's rather pointless to debate the so called existence of God and that is not what I 'm doing here I believe that God is the source and ground of being When you say that god does not exist I also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different things by it However in what follows I will use the phrase the existence of God in it's 'usual sense and this is the sense that I think you are using it I would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of God We also might differ upon what it means to have faith Here is what faith 1a allegiance to duty or a person LOYALTY b 1 fidelity to one 's promises 2 sincerity of intentions 2a 1 belief and trust in and loyalty to God 2 belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b 1 firm belief in something for which there is no proof 2 complete trust 3 something that is believed esp with strong conviction esp a system of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist When you say that you believe God does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation I will have to ask what observtions are you refering to There are NO observations pro or con that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief All observations can only point you in a direction a direction that we might even be predisposed to by predisposed I mean for example people whoes partents believe in God also tend to To actually draw a conclusion about the existence or non-existence of God requires a leap and you have made this leap when you actively say I believe that God does/does not exist Personally I think that both statements are misguided Arguing over the existence of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him and yes I use Him because a personal God is the only viable concept IMO if a person wants to use She go ahead Of course God is neither He nor She but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise If you want me to explain myself further I 'll be glad to And please if someone does not agree with me even if they violently disagree it 's in no ones advantage to start name calling If a person thinks I 've misunderstood something in the FAQs or if they they think I have not read them well enough just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation I 'm interested in a polite and well thought out discussion

religion,alt.atheism,You know it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing can be blamed solely on Mary So she 's married to Joseph She gets knocked up What do you think ol Joe will do if he finds she 's been getting around So Mary comes up with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant Nice attempt Chris verrry close You missed the conspiracy by 1 step Joseph knew who knocked her up He could n't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol Mary prego That would n't do well for his popularity in the local circles So what happened is that she was feeling guilty he was feeling embarrassed and THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both Clever indeed Come to think of it I have gained a new respect for the couple Maybe Joseph and Mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,It 's not a cliche and unlike your comments below it 's not a tautology It need n't have been true If every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality i.e if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them simply because the ability to actively prevent runs would be much weaker If that 's your point you should have said so What you in fact said was Pitching and defense win championships and later Pitching is the essence of baseball Neither of which says what you are now claiming was your point and neither of which is true And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches It 's not clear to me at all that this is true In high-scoring games the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time In low- scoring games the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability I thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is the essence of baseball

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching So far no takers Personally I think Harris is a defensive liability and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays or at least been among the leaders Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day he can get the job done If Sharpy played just one base every day say third he 'd also improve defensively Wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has Reed The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances The Dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls in the infield than last year And Piazza has also been great on defense He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first Wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on defense But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs But I do n't think he is as bad as his current average I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs

religion,soc.religion.christian,It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it A good example of this is Abraham referred to in the James passage Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith but his faith was demonstrated through his works i.e. he obeyed what God told him to do Reading Abraham 's biography in Genesis is very instructive He was a man beset by lack of faith a lot of the time e.g lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions trying to fulfil God 's promise on God 's behalf by copulating with Hagar yet it seems that God did n't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents Abraham is listed as one of the heroes of faith in Hebrews 11 i.e. when it really came to the crunch God declared Abraham as a man of faith He believed God 's promises This gives us confidence Although real faith demonstrates itself through works God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works Not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit Titus 3.5 Amazing Grace Hallelujah

prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel X XABOUT THIS FILE X X This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X the International Obfuscated C Code Contest IOCCC for short X X This is not the IOCCC rules though it does contain comments about X them The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions X Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X allowed Even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines X X You should read the current IOCCC rules prior to submitting entries X The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines X X Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993 X X The entry format is better for us anyway The program mkentry.c X has been updated See ENTRY FORMAT X X We will reject entries that can not be compiled using an ANSI C X compiler Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X fits are no longer permitted Some of the new issues deal with X non-integral array types variable number of arguments C preprocessor X directives and the exit function See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS X X You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests See X FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners X X Keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries X may not be valid entries this year What was unique and novel one year X might be 'old the next year X X An entry is usually examined in a number of ways We typically apply X a number of tests to an entry X X look at the original source X convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X C pre-process the source ignoring include lines X C pre-process the source ignoring define and include lines X run it through a C beautifier X examine the algorithm X lint it X compile it X execute it X X You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests X You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X 'cleaned up by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier X X Your entry need not do well under all or in most tests In certain X cases a test is not important Entries that compete for the X 'strangest/most creative source layout need not do as well as X others in terms of their algorithm On the other hand given X two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that X does something interesting when you run it X X We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules As such we leave X the contest open for creative rule interpretation As in real life X programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X is important For this reason we often award 'worst abuse of the X rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way X X If you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know X in the remarks section Please note that an invitation to abuse X is not an invitation to break We are strict when it comes to the X 3217 byte size limit Also abusing the entry format tends to X annoy more than amuse X X We do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries X to attempt to exploit them We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X and then plug the hole next year Even so we will attempt to use X the smallest plug needed if not smaller X X Check out your program and be sure that it works We sometimes make X the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly X in or near the final round On the other hand we have seen some X of the best entries fall down because they did n't work X X We tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that X 16 is a prime number If you do have a bug you are better off X documenting it Noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X of a prime by mistake would save the above entry And sometimes X a strange bug/feature can even help the entry Of course a correctly X working entry is best X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES X X Doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old We X tend to 'see thru masses of defines due to our pre-processor tests X that we apply Simply abusing defines or -Dfoo=bar wo n't go as far X as a program that is more well rounded in confusion X X Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code and so do we X X define d define X d foo do n't expect this to turn into define foo X X int i X j do n't use such implicit type declaration X int k X X We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler If you X must use non-ANSI C such as K R C you must avoid areas that result in X compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers X X Unfortunately some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of X integral type Thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should X not be used in 1993 This rule may be relaxed in future contests X X int i X char c X i c use c i instead X i+3 string use string i+3 instead X X If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X arguments be careful Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X of ways Because of this a number of operations using va_list are X not portable and must not be used X X assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X performing arithmetic on va_list variables X using va_list as a structure or union X X In particular do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char 's X X Avoid using varargs.h use stdarg.h instead X X If you use C preprocessor directives define if ifdef X the leading must be the first character on a line While some X C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not X X Because the exit function returns void on some systems entries X must not assume that it returns an int X X Small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise X While such programs are not as complex as other winners they do X serve a useful purpose They are often the only program that people X attempt to completely understand For this reason we look for X programs that are compact and are instructional X X One line programs should be short one line programs say around 80 X bytes long Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion X X We tend to dislike programs that X X are very hardware specific X are very OS or Un x version specific X index/strchr differences are ok but socket/streams specific X code is likely not to be X dump core or have compiler warnings X it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark header item X wo n't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un x X abusing the build file to get around the size limit X obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X are longer than they need to be X are similar to previous winners X are identical to previous losers X X Unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the X 'best one liner category we suggest that you format your program X in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines X X The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X limit It is one thing to make use of a several -D 's to help out X but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D 's in order to X try and squeeze the source under the size limit You should feel X free to make use of the build file space but you are better off X if you show some amount of restraint X X We allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact X your program size up to a certain point because we want to get X away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters X X Given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob X of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X program we tend to favor the second version Of course a third X version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X and/or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two X X We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X program We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X to be the smallest There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X programs In fact a number of winners have been self-replicating X You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest lest we or others X know of a smaller one X X X client entries should be as portable as possible Entries that X adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored Don't X depend on a particular type of display For example do n't depend X on color or a given size Do n't require backing store X X X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X software that is not in wide spread use We ask that such X client X entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X Athena widget set libX11.a libXaw.a libXmu.a and libXt.a X Do n't use M tif Xv ew or OpenL ok toolkits since not everyone X has them Avoid depending on a particular window manager Not X everyone has X11r5 and some people are stuck back in X11r4 or X earlier so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5 Better X yet try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems X X X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X .Xdefaults If you must do so be sure to note the required lines X in the -remark section X X We like programs that X X are as concise and small as they need to be X do something at least quasi-interesting X pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice X are portable X are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X make us laugh and/or throw up X X Some types of programs ca n't excel in some areas Of course your X program does n't have to excel in all areas but doing well in several X areas really does help X X We freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in X the -remark section helps your chance of winning If you had to X read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two X We think the readers of the contest winners do as well X X Be creative X X XENTRY FORMAT X X In order to help us process the many entries we must request your X assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way This format X in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the X author from the program itself see JUDGING PROCESS X X We have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to X format entries You should be aware of the following warning that X is found in mkentry.c X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules In all cases X where this program differs from the contest rules the X contest rules will be used Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry X X You are not required to use mkentry It is convenient however X as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check X the entry against the size rules X X If you have any suggestions comments fixes or

above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win award X we would use chonglab.c and chonglab X X If your entry depends on or requires that your build source X and/or binary files be a particular name please say so in the X -remark section If this case applies it would be be helpful X if you did one of the following X X Tell us how to change the filename s in your entry X X Have the build file make

touching your original build source and binary files You should X arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify This X will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch X X Remember that your entry may be built without a build file We X typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile If the X build file must exist say so in the -remark section X X If your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them X into -info sections In the case of multiple info files X use multiple -info sections If no info files are needed X then skip the -info section X X Info files are intended to be input or detailed information that X does not fit well into the -remark section For example an X entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X programs for the user to compile An entry might want to include a X lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a X 'hints file X X Info files should be used only to supplement your entry For X example info files may provide sample input or detailed X information about your entry Because they are supplemental X the entry should not require them exist X X In some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name X conflicts If info files should not be renamed for some reason X say so in the -remark section X X Info files must uudecode into the current directory If they X absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub-directory say X so in the -remark section X X When submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has X a unique entry number from 0 to 7 Your first entry should X have entry number 0 X X With the exception of the header all text outside of the entry X format may be ignored That is do n't place text outside of the X entry and expect the judges to see it Our decoding tools aren't X AI progs If you need tell the the something put it in the X -remark section or send a Email to the judges at X X apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judges not the address for X judges toad.com submitting entries X X The date should be given with respect to UTC Some systems refer X to this as GMT or GMT0 The format of the date should be that as X returned by asctime in the C locale An example of such a string is X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X This format is similar to the output of the date 1 command The X string does not include the timezone name before the year On

resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be X replaced X X XJUDGING PROCESS X X Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll X X Entries are unpacked into individual directories The Email message X is unpacked into individual files each containing X X -entry section X all -author sections X all -info sections X -build section X -program section X any other text including the Email message headers X X Prior to judging the 'any other text file is scanned to be sure X it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was X malformed and did not unpack correctly Information from the X -author sections are not read until the judging process is X complete and then only from entries that have won an award X X The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X individual We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X until the final awards are given We like the surprise of finding X out in the end who won and where they were from X X We attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award X Because the main 'prize of winning is being announced we make all X attempts to send non-winners into oblivion We remove all non-winning X files and shred all related paper By tradition we do not even X reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious X we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X winners at talks X X After the Usenix announcement we attempt to send Email to the X authors of the winning entries One reason we do this is to give X the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X entry They are given the chance to correct mistakes typos We X often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well X This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world X X Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds During a round X the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles X the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does X not We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X previous round Thus an entry gets at least two readings X X A reading consists of a number of actions X X reading the -entry section X reading the uudecoded -build section X reading the uudecoded -program section X reading the uudecoded -info section s if any X passing the source thru the C pre-processor X shipping over any include files X performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X shipping over any include files X X In later rounds other actions are performed X X linting the source X compiling/building the source X running the program X performing misc tests on the source and binary X X Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries entries X are judged on an individual basis An entry is set aside because it X does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round X When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries we begin to form X award categories Entries begin to compete with each other for awards X An entry often will compete in several categories X X The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X we receive A typical category list might be X X best small one line program X best small program X strangest/most creative source layout X most useful obfuscated program X best game that is obfuscated X most creatively obfuscated program X most deceptive C code X best X client see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES X best abuse of ANSI C X worst abuse of the rules X anything else so strange that it deserves an award X X We do not limit ourselves to this list For example a few entries are so X good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round X We will invent awards categories for them if necessary X X In the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of X reducing the remaining entries typically about 25 down to 8 or 10 X winners Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X make it The selection of the winners out of the final round is X less clear cut X X Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out X by a similar but slightly better entry For this reason it is X sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X that failed to win in a previous year This assumes of course X that the entry is worth improving in the first place X X More often that not we select a small entry usually one line a X strange/creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest X rules in some way X X In the end we traditionally pick one entry as 'best Sometimes such X an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry More often the X 'best is picked because it does well in a number of categories X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS X X The first announcement occurs at a Summer Usenix conference By tradition X this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF just prior to X the Berkeley BSD and BSDI BOF X X Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups X X comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X In addition pointers to these postings are posted to

politics,talk.politics.guns,I keep hearing this but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two As far as I am concerned I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given NATIONAL exposure Well it never was it was broadcast locally in a chopped-up fashion and that 's all And even then they cleverly cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded national exposure but not so cleverly that we did n't hear it The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript We 'll never know if he would have kept that one Strangely enough the previous day they said they were prepared to wait as long as it takes Quite possible But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing line between guilt and innocence only the line between murder and negligent manslaughter This would be an interesting development It 's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to go state's evidence parrot the FBI story hang the whole suicide on Koresh claim they only stayed at gunpoint etc If any of them do this in the next few weeks it does n't prove much but if none of them do it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is dead wrong

religion,soc.religion.christian,The story I related is one of the seven apparitions approved by our Church as worthy of belief It happened in La Salle France The moral lesson of the story is The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings This will continue while we disobey God or sin against Him Mary as a messenger has been given the task to make us be 'aware of the evil serpent communism wars famine unfaithful disobedience to God etc running after the rest of her offsprings The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is brought back by her peace and loving messages reparations for sins to obey God 's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence of The Lamb As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb Mary has been preparing us the Church the Body of Christ for His second coming making sure we are protected from the dragon Also she has been preparing the new Eden by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming I relate the story again I believe this and Mary in one of her apparitions in 19th or 20th century she appeared to these two children who tends goats and cows I forgot the exact place She was weeping and telling the children that she is afraid she 's going to lose her Son 's arm She is mourning too for these townfolks because it was their fault that there would be drought in their harvest not much good food again this year as it was last year Mary tells the children Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole week even on Sundays when they should be in church honoring God These townfolks swears and uses her Son 's name in bad words That is why her Son 's arm is so heavy in pain Then she asked them if they pray The children said hardly She asked them to pray every morning and night When the children went back from work they had to tell somebody about this When the news was spred and after thorough investigation of the incident the townfolks were converted and faith and obedience to God were restored in their community Once again the Lamb succeeds

science,sci.med,I 've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme Ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better especially if they have muscular or joint problems But like chiropracty there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique In the case of massage there is a technique called deep abdominal massage in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes By this vigorous and painful procedure it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed out
science,sci.med,I think we agree on much However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of progress and rationality in science Since I 've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past I wo n't go into them again now What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery If experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication This is what leads one ala Feyerabend to an anything goes view True the generation part can be totally irrational But typically it is not Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one 's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science
politics,talk.politics.mideast,"Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition In Bosnia Muslim is not merely a religious category but an ethnic one as well Actually here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject 1 There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality and Bosnian Muslims are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith 2 Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be Croats nor Serbs In 1968 argument 2 was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid and 1 was soundly rejected The reasons are pragmatic even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor 's actual nationality In fact although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity So arguments like yes but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs carry very little weight Regardless of what their ancestors might have been as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group that ends the debate What outsiders say is simply not relevant In the case of former Yugoslavia the date is 1971 when Muslim nationality appeared as a census category for the first time This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade from recognizing Bosniaks as an ethnic group 1961 to February 1968 resolution in B-H declaring that Muslims are a separate nation to formal endorsement of this in January 1969 and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of Muslim nationality choice in census forms For comparison in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina Serb-Muslims 71,991 Croat-Muslims 25,295 Muslims ethnically undeclared 788,403 This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have consistently opted for a third category in 1948 they chose undeclared in 1953 they chose Yugoslavs in 1961 both Yugoslavs and Bosniak ethnic group and in 1971 1981 and 1991 they chose Muslim nationality Perhaps the term Bosnian Muslim nationality is too confusing for the rest of the world But in the present context we ARE talking about Muslims as nationality not as a religous group within some separate national identity The reasons are mostly historical and cultural Religion plays a smaller role as a part of culture in general because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism Political fanaticism yes religious fanaticism no Group security and survival dominate people 's thinking not fine points of theology In fact Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime"

politics,talk.politics.mideast,And the 'Turkish Karabag is next As for 'Cyprus In 1974 Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there This is nothing but a simple historical fact Unfortunately the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot officials and their violation of the co-founder status of the Turks set out in the constitution The coup d'etat engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked Turkiye 's intervention Turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus There simply was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at all This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which was openly expansionist stated as 'Enosis union with Greece Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960 the Turkish population although smaller legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population The Greek Cypriots with the support of Greeks in the mainland have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo She would rather not be involved with the island But given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus she simply can not leave the fate of the island 's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights liberties and their very lives Source 'Cyprus The Tale Of An Island A.

science,sci.crypt,Hmmm Check your facts Good advice Let 's check Mr. Cain's facts a bit shall we FACT It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP whether or not one is charging for it Furthermore any use of RSA other than for research purposes allowed under US patent law is similarly unlawful Therefore the average citizen can not use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP There is no licensed freely available product in the US that uses RSA encryption other than RSAREF and hence RIPEM at least as far as I am aware If you know of another please post it here FACT The last contact I had with RSA Data Security Inc was with some guy trying to sell me a license unsolicited I might add for TIPEM Cost 15K plus 2-5 percent royalties I suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count as mucho bucks or incredibly reasonable Either way however this definitely falls into the routines they tell you to use FACT There are no restrictions yet on the use of cryptography under US law although this is beginning to look like it will change The only impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's patents Mr. Cain please shut up until you get your facts straight Better than the whole world be destroyed and crumble to dust than a free man deny one of his desires -Benito Mussolini Italian anarchist and poet

religion,soc.religion.christian,excellent question timothy i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory as we can not understand the mind of god but to attempt to answer you clearly GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he intends to judge mankind the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god the bible calls this sin for those who die before the end of the world/have already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world however there is no plus and minus system for GOD he has declared that he can not tolerate spiritual imperfection thus he can only based your worthiness to live with him on the wrong in your life Good people yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD The Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin 's penalty the proscribed punishment for sin is death just as the proscribed punishment for robbery is time in jail God then can not ask for anything but punishement for those sins He does not want to condem the Bible says in John 3:17 that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that through him it might be saved when i realize that i have sinned and i do with painful regularity i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin against me i have that right and privlige only because of Christ as for Jews they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come and dis come in Jesus of Nazereth Muslims i fear have been given a lie from the fater of lies Satan They need Christ as do us all for those who do n't have that right in the view of the bible they stand olone in their defense are you going to hell i can not answer that for you i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to Hell that step is much more rewarding stan toney stoney oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own you may borrow them

n't your argument that there has to be more More than what More than we assume Which is what exactly a Most of the people I debate disagree with my premises Hardly debate otherwise Your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged more than once When I did it you said good question and did not address it I 've addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with Eric Rescorla b There 's little point in responding the same points everywhere I do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply You still repeat that point I do Curious since I believe that was the first time I 've ever made it Not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability to understand you ask me the same question I 'll give you the same answer especially when in this case I know the answer to be true I do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is making the same points and I 'm pushed for time then I try to respond what I believe are the strongest formulations of those points If that doesn't include your post tough this is USENET and life is tough all over c Since there 's a great deal of responses this is n't always feasible I do my best to honestly answer questions put to me You drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others You appear with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning again I 've only debated this issue twice in a.a and occasionally in t.a The first was in response to Simon Clippingdale 's positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative It does n't Now Simon has dropped out of the debate for some time I take that to mean that he is either busy or bored with the topic I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty Do you d I ca n't always understand what you say Neither ca n't I understand you all the time Usually one asks what the other side means Usually one does Usually you 're clear but sometimes you are n't and I ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight and I feel that I 'm debating against line noise Sometimes I get tired and sometimes I have other things I 'd rather do Again this is USENET and life is tough all over You 're going to have to deal with it e You 're starting to get personally insulting I may not even put your name in the hat in future That 's supposed to be a threat No that 's a simple statement and an assertion that I am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults For example those who accuse me of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that I do n't answer their questions Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there If only everything would be so easy What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there Because to all intents and purposes it is there We had that argument For one your claim that everyone senses it is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often And then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it is there unless evidence against it has been found I have no problem with the second statement I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom It 's a good point and I 'm thinking about it Your trick is to say I feel A is not right and so do many I know therefore A is absolutely right It neglects the possibility that these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject of that process In other words refutes it You make the ontological claim you have to prove it Nonsense My trick is to say I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask Best evidence is therefore that A really is better than B subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent Now get this really is better is an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model It may or may not correspond to something true It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_ Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist trick to wit I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask However if even one person disagrees that A is better than B or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B then it is the case that B is better than A for that person and nothing more can be said I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A can not morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B e.g a terrorist To do that would be to claim that a supermajority 's carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist 's which would of course be true but a no-no for an ethical relativist To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion For a similar argument I sense morality is subjective it does not hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by others If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you of course this is possible It is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to judgements is absolute And as long as you do n't provide evidence for that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to believe your hypothesis I 've done this freedom with the proviso that I still have to answer jon 's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning Further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes above look quite misleading Not really What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently of humans You 'll be hard pressed to find any that is n't logically equivalent when applied to values An analogous set of premises would be Premise 1 Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest route from my house to a bar is through the main entrance of the estate and down the Malahide road Premise 2 I checked it out and found that the shortest route from my which is much closer You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim using premises which are logically no different No Morals are a matter of belief so far The people still believe that the shortest way is through the main entrance No agreement on belief here And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it is the shortest way indeed In other words your analogy works only when one assumes that your premises are right in the first place If not it is a fallacy And if this were an argument for objectivism you 'd be right It is n't though it 's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument against objectivism nor argument for relativism Your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values are n't real and to use this to prove that values are n't real In other words you beg the question against me

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,I agree and disagree John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses While you are probably correct that 400 does not mean 4 more wins then losses it means something I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1 in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5 in each of 400 PAs Thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John 's statistic and winning games Thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has First we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game Second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning That is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases Thus I 'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game Sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one Also the pitchers bad performances giving up 6 runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game Also any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives No but really only because you have a smaller sample size I would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning And realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning Look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games On the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win The offence has many more outs to do something about But I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either If I am down 8 runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth No but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made Look if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball And do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team would win From reading all of the discussion on this statistic I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda At first look this statistic valadates clutchness But it really does not Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down I 've never seen convincing proof that this really happens So if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness Certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example We may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15 on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5 I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses How do we evaluate relief pitchers Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs K 's BB 's etc Both had exceptional numbers John however only pitched in closer situations while Sam was a Mop up man Who was more valuble to their team Probably John Who was the better pitcher They were probably about the same
religion,soc.religion.christian,Just a quick question If Mary was Immaculately concieved so she could be a pure vessel does this mean that she was without sin and therefore the perfect meaning sinless female human being Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite it 's basically patriarchical structure She was immaculately conceived and so never subject to Original Sin but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God and everything that flows from that relationship The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve The Fathers in the early Church use this particular figure a lot

science,sci.crypt,It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a police agency It just might be a bad idea for them too OK suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect 's phone They need a warrant just like the old days But unlike the old days they now need to a get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of the key Now what happens if there 's a tiff between the two escrow houses Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics while potentially good leads disappear lives and property are lost statutes of limitations run out etc Not to mention a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed Or using stolen ones Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license There 's also bureacracy and security problems within each escrow house how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with and it might take a LONG time to get that key Even when a request is approved how is the key going to be disclosed Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government with a databank of the necessary size and data traffic of the projected volume there 's going to be a lot of weak links How many of these kinds of problems will be open for public or expert scrutiny Furthermore the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around even to State Police agencies a trust and security issue This would be an especially acute issue if some other State 's Police had mishandled a key resulting in lawsuits financial settlements and political embarassment So the Feds implement it this way b some federal agency gets the keys performs the tap and turns the results over to the NY State Police But let 's say Cuomo 's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case Now not only do we have the keys as a political chit we have an extra player in the game and we have the tap 's tapes as another bargaining chit Again the State Police lose I understand that legal wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain In scenario b who pays the bill

What 's the difference I believe the pediatrician I went to for many years was a D.O and he did n't seem different from any other doctor I 've seen over the years My dictionary says that osteopathy is a medical therapy that emphasizes manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought to cause disease and inhibit recovery Jeez this sounds like chiropractic I remember getting shots and medicine from my pediatrician D.O. and do n't remember any manipulative techniques Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the real practical difference between an M.D and a D.O Also I'm interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who follows one or the other medical philosophy Readers of sci.med Please respond directly to sbrenner attmail.com I do not read this group regularly and probably wo n't see your response if you just post it here Sorry for the cross-posting but I 'm hoping there 's some expertise here a T d H v A a N n K c S e
politics,talk.politics.guns,Dennis Deconcini 1982 In these and similar areas the Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense but of 5 U.S.C Sec 552 which was intended to prevent secret lawmaking by administrative bodies These practices amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing Richard Davis speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department asserted vaguely that the Bureau 's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators particularly felons ille- gally in possession and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions In hearings before BATF 's Appropriations Subcommittee however expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations Exerpt from 97th Congress 2d Session COMMITTEE PRINT T H E R I G H T T O K E E P A N D B E A R A R M S REPORT of the SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION of the COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION FEBRUARY 1982 Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 88-618 O WASHINGTON 1982 Letter to Constituent April 1993 Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms ATF which is the Federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms especially in the area of drug-related crimes It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out an illegal activity The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence also both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons The Waco Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession automatics semi-automatics and machine-guns in addition to bombs and other explosives In virtually every gun case ATF is asked to trace weapons through its National Firearms Tracing Center where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information ATF is the Federal governments firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants ATF working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S Attorneys office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians In addition ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning knowing from their source inside that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored As you may be aware by now Vernon Howell a.k.a David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants Unfortunately ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves and prepare for ATFs entry into the compound Once a hostage situation presented itself the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations In addition and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians Based on what I have learned about ATF 's role in the Branch Davidian raid I believe the agency acted responsibly I am however deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult I fully expect the Department of Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement In addition ATF will conduct its own review of the Waco operation I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion Sincerely Dennis DeConcini Chairman Subcommittee on Treasury Postal Service and General Government April 7 1993

science,sci.med,If people are going to do this I really wish they would tell me first I 'd be happy to go over the insert in the PDR with them and explain everything All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one Some of them probably did n't even come back for followup because they did n't want to admit they would n't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something What people do n't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported without substantiating that the drug was responsible The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific There are very few drugs that someone has n't reported a death from taking Patients do n't realize that and do n't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly I 'm sure Herman is going to go ballistic but so be it Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that This can be a real problem for PDR readers There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need I am involved in a research project to do that with migraine as the domain It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient For common illnesses such as migraine and hypertension this may help quite a bit The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician Clearly physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but did n't Why they did n't is n't always the physician 's fault either Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask They wo n't be as afraid to ask the system we hope Gordon Banks N3JXP Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre.dsl.pitt.edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon

science,sci.crypt,It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure It 's in the hands of cops and while I am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses Getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as I understand the proposal I could be wrong but I 've seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities As the EFF noted this raises further issues about the fruits of one bust leading to incrimination in other areas But is it any worse than the current unsecure system It becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main concern of most of us I think The camel 's nose in the tent etc And it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is increased thus allowing greater access to central office records by the government the conversations being encrypted who will object to letting the government have access to them perhaps even automatically archiving large fractions This was one of the main objections to the S.266 proposal that it would force telecom suppliers to provide easy access for the government One the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted conversations now all it takes is one misstep one violation that gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt all of them Do we want anyone to have this kind of power -Tim May whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime

science,sci.space,"From another space forum When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media It 's been a long time since something like this happened We've lost washers and bolts before but never a tool like this The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd Unfortunately the worker 's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its extra payload NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster its 18-inch long rope was still attached The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take appropriate action Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch Karl Anderson DEV/2000 Configuration Management/Version Control Dept 53K/006-2 Rochester Minnesota 55901 253-8044 Tie 8-453-8044 INTERNET karl vnet.ibm.com PRODIGY CMMG96A"

politics,talk.politics.mideast,From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Final Solution for Gaza Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Gazans The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza some 700.000 people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan resistance The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice A population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors As is known the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels shops and fields Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in Israel They may not live there for these areas are reserved for the Master Race The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the right to self- administration They selected Jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance Some Jewish collaborators were killed Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self-determination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings This attitude is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews The current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea One is led to ask oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the Gazans Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

religion,soc.religion.christian,Andrew How I wish this were true and how I long for the day in which it will be true But alas it is not true of history The Bible does not have a message it has messages And some of those are messages of repentance and giving to turn the other cheek and do unto the least of these But some of the messages are the complete opposite Like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle and punished severely when they were less than complete about the job Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust Have these been misunderstood I think not They have only been understood too clearly It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent symbol for how we should be his teachings we must take to heart but we can not ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone Instead we must let the text critique the text Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus we test all things and hold fast to that which is good At the risk of sounding heretical well ok more heretical I do n't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness it is something which requires introspection and reflection If that is a sin then there can be no salvation for doubt is an inescapble part of being human Consider Job His friends had no doubt Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God When God finally did appear he rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them To be a Christian it to always have doubt or not to have honesty
religion,soc.religion.christian,For example why does the universe exist at all Whether there is a why or not we have to find it This is Pascal 's wager If there is no why and we spend our lives searching then we have merely wasted our lives which were meaningless anyway If there is a why and we Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old and suppose it lasts another 5 billion years Suppose I live to be 100 That is nothing that is so small that it is scary So by searching for the why along with my friends here on earth if nothing else we are n't so scared I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator does not seem like much of a basis for belief And the logic is also appalling God must exist because I want Him to I have heard this line of reasoning before and wonder how prevalent it is Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is hopeless or so the pollsters and newscasts state but I do n't see where this is a good reason to become religious If you want 'meaning' why not just join a cult such as in Waco The leaders will give you the security blanket you desire

science,sci.med,That 's ridiculous They are n't designed they evolved And much as it discomforts us in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time To give you an idea my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives and we never could figure out which wife had each child One might ask why this happened My great-great- grandfathers were by the time they reached their forties quite prosperous farmers Nonetheless they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth the graveyards in Spencer Indiana and Boswell North Dakota contain quite a few gravestones like Ida wf of Jacob Liptrap and baby May 6 1853 More like one in ten And the consequences can be devastating I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth It is n't always fatal But it is often fatal when it happens out of reach of adequate help More often it permanently damages one 's health Clearly women 's bodies _evolved_ to give birth I am no believer in divine design however evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans My are n't we wroth I have n't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months I can practically see your mouth foam We 're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks Although I ca n't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks I would n't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated on the other hand I am opposed on obvious grounds to waiting until an emergency to give in And bear this in mind my wife took the lead in all of these decisions We talked things over and I did a lot of the leg work but the main decisions were really hers I do n't know of very many home birth advocates even that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home But people should bother to find out the relative risks My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings In view of the intensity of the birth experience I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway Somehow the values you 're advocating seem all lopsided to me taking risks even if fairly small of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is after all an esthetic consideration

religion,alt.atheism,If you were omniscient you 'd know who exactly did what and with what purpose in mind Then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal In an objective system there are known goals Then actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals or not Simple The problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ That is the goals of each society are different Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one I 've said it many many times Which part do you have a problem with But we can enslave the animals right But just not kill them Or are you a vegetarian for health reasons No I fail to see how my personal views are relevant anyway Of course not It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species for food It might be nice though if the other animals were not made to suffer For instance a cow in a field lives out its life just about the same way it would in the wild They seem happy enough However the veal youngsters are n't treated very well I do n't know What is the goal of this particular system There is no inherent system Nope Again it seems okay to kill other species for food

science,sci.crypt,After reading the debate over the Clipper I have a few things to add First most of the people I know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US All they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not That after all IS the bottom line Second if I look at all the people I know who use any form of encryption at all and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies I can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse The Clipper does this because people make mistakes by nature and the US government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else Third since most of the people I know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies I ca n't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it So I can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip Fourth when it comes to criminal abuse sure there are many stupid people out there And yes some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the Clipper Chip However anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and I would assume start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption If nothing else were avalible none of this would be an issue However the truth is that most private encryption users that I 've ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything else If it works they use it This is not going to change either I do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip It is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is if anything the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user The bottom line here is that people will use what works and unavoidibly I 'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag Or if you have an interest in snooping Pandora 's Box has been opened and this is not going to change I 've seen a blindness to this that I 've found utterly stunning and the Clipper Chip along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree Sincerly Tim Scanlon

recreation,rec.sport.baseball,Not necessarily It could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road see Frank Thomas home/road splits in '91 for an example I would guess that some of Alomar 's split is due to the Skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence There 's no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and Alomar is not a home run hitter Only because of t P 's bogus fielding stats which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league On a career basis I think T P's fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is but he sure is n't the worst in baseball Offensively T P rate Alomar much higher last year Regarding the A vs. B argument I 'll just say they 're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future

computer,comp.graphics,Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it We bought this thing because it 1 has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and 2 claimed to print 256 gray level images However the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs This was not mentioned in the sales literature However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel 64 level images in parallel mode but they did n't have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call Japan etc Frankly I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source it ca n't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory It 's not like memory is that expensive any more If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel or even 8 bit/pixel images out of this thing I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me Thanks

computer,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong along with most other of the CMOS data Try replacing the battery If however your PC does n't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery If this is n't possible make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day this will keep the capacitor charged I 'd opt for the battery change though
