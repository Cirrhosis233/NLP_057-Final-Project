economic vitality real challenge protecting americans rather use technology accommodate sometimes competing interest economic growth privacy law enforcement previous policy pitted government industry right privacy law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology ha used year protect electronic fund transfer used protect electronic mail computer file encryption technology help americans protect business secret unauthorized release personal information also used terrorist drug dealer criminal state-of-the-art microcircuit called clipper chip ha developed government engineer chip represents new approach encryption technology used new relatively inexpensive encryption device attached ordinary telephone scramble telephone communication using encryption algorithm powerful many commercial use today new technology help company protect proprietary information protect privacy personal phone conversation prevent unauthorized release data transmitted electronically time technology preserve ability federal state local law enforcement agency intercept lawfully phone conversation criminal key-escrow system established ensure clipper chip used protect privacy law-abiding americans device containing chip two unique 2 key number needed authorized government agency decode message encoded device device manufactured two key deposited separately two key-escrow data base established attorney general access key limited government official legal authorization conduct wiretap clipper chip technology provides law enforcement new authority access content private conversation americans demonstrate effectiveness new technology attorney general soon purchase several thousand new device addition respected expert outside government offered access confidential detail algorithm ass capability publicly report finding chip important step addressing problem encryption 's dual-edge sword encryption help protect privacy individual industry also shield criminal terrorist need clipper chip approach provide law-abiding citizen access encryption need prevent criminal using hide illegal activity order ass technology trend explore new approach like key-escrow system president ha directed government agency develop comprehensive policy encryption accommodates privacy citizen including need employ voice data encryption business purpose ability authorized official access telephone call data proper court legal order necessary protect citizen effective timely use modern technology build national information infrastructure needed promote economic growth competitiveness american industry global marketplace need u.s. company manufacture export high technology product president ha directed early frequent consultation affected industry congress group advocate privacy right individual policy option developed 3 administration committed working private sector spur development national information infrastructure use new telecommunication computer technology give americans unprecedented access information infrastructure high-speed network information superhighway transmit video image hdtv programming huge data file easily today 's telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology play increasingly important role infrastructure federal government must act quickly develop consistent comprehensive policy regarding use administration committed policy protect americans right privacy also protecting break law information provided accompanying fact sheet provision president 's directive acquire new encryption technology also available additional detail call mat heyman national institute standards technology 301 975-2758 questions answers clinton administration's telecommunications initiative q approach expand authority government agency listen phone conversation clipper chip technology provides law enforcement new authority access content private conversation americans q suppose law enforcement agency conducting wiretap drug smuggling ring intercept conversation encrypted using device would decipher message would obtain legal authorization normally court order wiretap first place would present documentation authorization two entity responsible safeguarding key obtain key device used drug smuggler key split two part stored separately order ensure security key escrow system q run key-escrow data bank two key-escrow data bank run two independent entity point department justice administration yet determine agency oversee key-escrow data bank q strong security device sure strong security system secure many voice encryption system readily available today algorithm remain classified protect security key escrow system willing invite independent panel cryptography expert evaluate algorithm assure potential user unrecognized vulnerability q whose decision wa propose product national security council justice department commerce department key agency involved decision approach ha endorsed president vice president appropriate cabinet official q wa consulted congress industry on-going discussion congress industry encryption issue expect discussion intensify carry review encryption policy briefed member congress industry leader decision related initiative q government provide hardware manufacturer government designed developed key access encryption microcircuit providing microcircuit product manufacturer product manufacturer acquire microcircuit chip manufacturer produce q provides clipper chip mykotronx program facility torrance california sell chip encryption device manufacturer programming function could licensed vendor future q buy one encryption device expect several manufacturer consider incorporating clipper chip device q administration unable find technological solution like one proposed would administration willing use legal remedy restrict access powerful encryption device fundamental policy question considered broad policy review key escrow mechanism provide americans encryption product secure convenient le expensive others readily available today one piece must comprehensive approach encryption technology administration developing administration saying since encryption threatens public safety effective law enforcement prohibit outright country effectively done u.s. saying every american matter right entitled unbreakable commercial encryption product false tension created assessment issue either-or proposition rather concern fact harmoniously balanced reasoned balanced approach proposed clipper chip similar encryption technique q doe decision indicate clinton administration 's policy toward encryption differ bush administration indicates understand importance encryption technology telecommunication computing committed working industry public-interest group find innovative way protect americans' privacy help business compete ensure law enforcement agency tool need fight crime terrorism q device exportable device use government hardware voice encryption device subject export control requirement case-by-case review export required ensure appropriate use device true encryption device one attraction technology protection give u.s. company operating home abroad mind expect export license granted case-by-case basis u.s. company seeking use device secure communication abroad plan review possibility permitting wider
