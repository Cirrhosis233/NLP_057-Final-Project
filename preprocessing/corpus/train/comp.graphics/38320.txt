boy embarass trivial faq given 4 point non coplanar one find sphere center radius exact fit point ? 
i know circl 3 point immedi see straightforward way 3-d . 
i check geometri book graphic gem farin still loss ? 
pleas merci provid solut ? 
it 's bad question i n't ref list algorithm either . 
but think bit n't hard . 
1 take three point find plane defin well circl lie say algorithm alreadi 2 find center circl . 
the line pass center perpendicular plane three point pass center sphere . 
3 repeat unus point two origin point . 
this give two differ line pass sphere 's origin . 
their interect center sphere . 
4 radius easi comput 's distanc center origin point . 
i ll leav math workabl algorithm . 
an altern method would take pair point plane form perpendicular bisector line segment pair also contain center sphere . 
three pair form three plane intersect point . 
this might easier implement .
