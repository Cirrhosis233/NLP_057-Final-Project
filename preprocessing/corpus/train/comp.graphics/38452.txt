first thank fill exist 68070 . 
i assum rash particular number would reserv enhanc motorola line rather mete anoth compani . 
ah well i guess 's i get i assum comput industri oper logic manner ! 
sean i n't want get mini-war ' i go say i littl bit skeptic perform claim centri ll see pleas no-flam i reserv c.s.m.a i chicago last consum electron show appl booth . 
i walk show real-tim video captur use radious supermac ? 
card digit make right spot quicktim movi . 
i think quicktim use old one 1.5 . 
version 1.5 quicktim state current version softwar . 
the older version 1.0 1.6 horizon distant futur . 
they digit guy talk 160x2xx someth . 
it play back quit nice real time . 
the guy expand window resiz 25x 3xx 320 i think frame rate decreas enough notic n't 30fps 30fps anymor . 
it drop like 15 fps . 
then increas bit drop 10-12 fps . 
quicktim much better job play back movi size play back resiz movi . 
appar process expand frame 's imag dither result bitmap appropri bit depth pretti processor-intens . 
there optim work pretti well show movi doubl size drop 1.9x size increas 2.1x size perform suffer dramat . 
then i ask mac use ... 
he use quadra n't know model 900 ? 
tell guy quicktim could play back speed even lcii . 
he lie . 
quicktim cpu depend . 
he probabl confus fact qt lock intern timecod play amount time machin . 
howev lc drop frame order keep sound video sync . 
the centri quadra similar cpus thus boast similar perform though quadra bit faster due margin faster clock speed somewhat differ architectur . 
well i spoil claim say sinc 68040 quadra mac littl bit troubl . 
and n't even hardisk ! 
this memori ! 
could saw either newer version quicktim hardwar assist centri anoth softwar product run anim like suppos macromind 's acceler ? ? 
i expect version quicktim softwar saw 1.0 i use 1.5 . 
one new codec v1.5 allow video near twice size frame rate version 1.0 could handl . 
the centri 650 i saw plain-vanilla except nice speaker play sound softwar movi player qt player appl includ softwar . 
do n't misunderstand i want clarifi .
