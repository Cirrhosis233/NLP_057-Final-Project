boy embarass trivial faq given 4 point non coplanar one find sphere center radius exact fit point ? 
i know circl 3 point immedi see straightforward way 3-d . 
i check geometri book graphic gem farin still loss ? 
pleas merci provid solut ? 
it 's bad question i n't ref list algorithm either . 
but think bit n't hard . 
1 take three point find plane defin well circl lie say algorithm alreadi 2 find center circl . 
the line pass center perpendicular plane three point pass center sphere . 
3 repeat unus point two origin point . 
this give two differ line pass sphere 's origin . 
their interect center sphere . 
4 radius easi comput 's distanc center origin point . 
i ll leav math workabl algorithm . 
good i bad feel problem special case solut worri . 
four coplanar point shape squar uniqu sphere surfac . 
similar 4 colinear point finit size sphere surfac . 
these algorithm geometr design rather algebra design meet problem neat . 
when determin plane 3 point colinear algorithm afil return infinit r . 
when intersect two line 2 possibl line 4 point planar circl differ line parallel . 
there sphere radius . 
this last case achiev 3 colini point 4th point take 4th point pair first 3 parallel line produc also achiev if 4 point coplanar one circl . 
it seem algorithm fail 4 point coplanar . 
the algorithm alway fail point coplanar . 
4 point colinear coplanar test 4th point coplanar plane first 3 point found trivial . 
an altern method would take pair point plane form perpendicular bisector line segment pair also contain center sphere . 
three pair form three plane intersect point . 
this might easier implement .
