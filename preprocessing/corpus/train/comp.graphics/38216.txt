accord tiff 5.0 specif tiff version number byte 2-3 42 chosen deep philosoph signific . 
last week i read hitchhik guid to the galaxi is actual pick number 42 ? 
i 'm sure i amus . 
everi time i read part tiff spec infuri me- i 'm none happi complex spec anyway- i think arbitrari care chosen number neither . 
addit i find choic 4 byte begin file meaningless themselves- use letter tiff ? 
and i n't think bother support word order either- i ve found mani tiff reader actual n't .
