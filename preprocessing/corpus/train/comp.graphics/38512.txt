i learn aw lot aspect ch graphic read group code hardwar ch algorithm . 
i think make 5 differ group ch wate result post week per group . 
ch i kind like conveni one big forum ch discuss aspect graphic . 
anyon els feel way ? 
ch just curious . 
i must agre . 
there dizzi number c.s.amiga . 
newsgroup alreadi . 
in addit issu fall clean one categori . 
also readili observ current spectrum amiga group alreadi plagu mega-crosspost thus group-split would likelihood bring structur environ . 
michael neron i shall customari lack tact internet address sinc ask oblig hi it might nice know 's possibl differ hard ware platform . 
but usual hard ware fix case either unix dos- pc so i 'm much interest amiga news . 
in case softwar i wo n't get comerci softwar mention newgroup run unix- platform i 'm interest inform . 
i would suggest split group . 
i n't see problem cross-post . 
then need read 2 newgroup half size . 
but what would be more import is to have a faq . 
this would reduc the traffic a lot . 
sincer gerhard
