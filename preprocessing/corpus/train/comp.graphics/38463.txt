about year ago i start work problem appear simpl turn quit difficult . 
i wonder anyon net seen problem hope publish solut . 
the problem draw outlin surfac defin two rough parallel cubic spline . 
for input problem essenti start two set point set point edg object treat two dimension i.e . 
extant edg exist three dimension space . 
to draw object 1 fit cubic spline point . 
each spline effect comput sequenc line segment approxim curv . 
each spline equal number segment . 
we assum nth segment along spline rough exact distanc along spline reason measur . 
2 take segment n along spline match nth segment oppos spline . 
use pair segment form two triangl fill color surfac . 
3 depth sort triangl 4 take triangl sort order project onto 2d pixmap draw color triangl . 
take edg triangl along edg surfac draw line along edg color special edg color it edg color step 4 heart problem . 
the idea effect outlin edg surfac . 
the net result howev general lot break gap edg surfac . 
the reason fair complic . 
they involv raster problem problem result project spline . 
if anyth problem sound familiar would appreci know work area .
