yes i awar coreldraw export scodal ... 
... 
tri export scodal 
bitmap say someth like export ... 
... if anyon know way around i ear . 
i think one ideal solut use trace util ca n't rememb name sorri ! 
includ corel draw sw pack . 
it convert bitmap corel art format . 
these import draw rather bitmap . 
result file complet corel format scodal' problem ! 
but slight problem make solut less idea trace util spit mani point necessari defin shape trace . 
straight line curv trace mani short segment . 
so ... 
scodal 
take much longer imag . 
the obvious solut time-consum strip extra point hand use corel . 
ouch ! 
i ve done time ... i wonder anyth bitmap scodal 
part tad cheaper . 
jeff lyall as i say n't mind problem go via rout ... 
bitmap corel via trace hand trim use corel ! ! ! 
combin with main corel pic via import scodal
