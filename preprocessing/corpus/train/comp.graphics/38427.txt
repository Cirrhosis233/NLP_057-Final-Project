anoth method first find center circl defin 2 set 3 point intersect normal . 
this would also defin circl center . 
howev small numer imprecis would make line intersect . 
suppos 3 plane have intersect uniqu point parallel . 
have thought n't project 2 line onto 2d plane form line . 
do intersect calcul plane 2d re guarante uniqu solut unless re parallel wo n't happen case use parametr distanc along line circl centr determin exact point interest . 
this bypass messi error propog requir calcul 3d . 
hope i n't put foot !
