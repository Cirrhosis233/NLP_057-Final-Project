i think re propos would work get extra one mayb two extra bit color resolut . 
howev display chould zero full intens primari i n't think 'd get great equival 24-bit photograph . 
i suggest i wrote problem problem clear visibl 7 bit bw imag mention 24 bit imag . 
descript experi delet if 1 bit imag view quick sync screen 100 intens could better i dunno . 
delet in case get black color slow machin problem . 
i could tri 8 bit screen i n't know render pixel x constant time . 
i recal doubl buffer imag color one bw n't help either . 
mayb i dump photo screen low level code ? 
a year ago friend i took 256 grey-level photo 1 bit mac plus screen use method . 
display 256 level synchron 60hz display took 10 second . 
after experi differ apertur set screen bright found rang work well give respect contrast . 
the qualiti imag pretti good . 
there visibl contrast band . 
to minim exposur time display program built 255 differ 1 bit frame . 
the first contain dot pixel valu 255 second pixel valu 254 etc . 
these frame store use spars data structur fast or ' onto screen sequenc . 
creat frame sometim took 5-10 minut old mac camera shutter close time anyway . 
and yes wrote direct screen memori . 
mea culpa . 
our biggest problem small imag display top left corner screen instead center . 
it took extra week film develop print processor took troubl manual move imag center print . 
who 'd guess ?
