i almost got hernia laugh one . 
you ll probabl get one realiz 100 vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech control suck ... 
if anyth scsi pc obsolete- kill vesa local with luck pc bus archeitectur doen sbus . 
have ever seen happen hook busmast control vesa local bus . 
it actual slow system bus ide . 
it must real nice get shaft 20-100 buck extra cost scsi drive pay anoth 200-300 scsi control . 
yeah absolut use vlb except video graphic . 
and ide could possibl take advantag vlb run 8 mhz 16 bit . 
do peopl forget ide specif design interfac direct at isa bus ? 
we ve seen ide come eisa xt isa even mca time 16 bit standard run somewher near 8-10 mhz . 
when run ide vlb 's way re run 33 mhz would burn . 
of cours goe scsi esdi whatev none run cpu speed . 
the way gain advantag vlb ide hook cach control . 
i suspect would much much better get softwar disk cach instead sinc get write-cach well . 
ide one make ide disk big . 
i ve seen fuji ide drive go high 1g .
