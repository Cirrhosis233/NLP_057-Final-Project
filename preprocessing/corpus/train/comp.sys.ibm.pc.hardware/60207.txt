topic cover document window 3.1 enhanc mode floppy-controller-bas tape backup devic sound card miscellan info pleas note part document contain technic sometim ters descript problem . 
for refer adaptec technic support 800 959-7274 adaptec bbs 24009600 408 945-7727 pleas send comment correct etc . 
via email compuserv 752063074 window 3.1 enhanc mode the window 3.1 instal program automat configur dos window use adaptec 1542 . 
howev case someth went wrong i 'm go describ chang need get window 3.1 work 1542 . 
also may notic instal window 3.1 make pc run much slower even re run window method speed discuss section call window 3.1 run slowli . 
msdos configur the window instal program add smartdriv disk cach config.si autoexec.bat file . 
if follow instruct ll notic ll need use double-buff smartdriv default setup . 
you ll also notic system run much much slower window and msdos . 
see section call window 3.1 run slowli way speed system . 
window configur to get adaptec 1542 work window make sure 388enh section system.ini file contain entri virtualhdirqoff i believ window instal program automat add entri system.ini i 'm sure . 
if n't work might want tri ad line virtualhdirqoff systemrombreakpointfals emmexcludea000-cfff you probabl n't need line though . 
the systemrombreakpoint entri use enabl support memori manag like qemm386max need use program . 
window 3.1 run slowli onc get window 3.1 run 1542 chanc system run much slower . 
if 's 's probabl 1 . 
you happen use aspi4dos.si version 3.1 config.si file . 
congratul appear win solut . 
2 . 
you lucki . 
whether luck hold remain seen .... 
if system run much slower almost definit caus smartdriv double-buff . 
accord window document microsoft technic note q81808 smartdriv doubl buffer requir aspi4dos.si must use smartdriv double-buff enabl . 
while work realli slow pc i estim slow pc factor 5 five . 
as i consid unaccept i look solut . 
unfortun disabl double-buff . 
if window 3.1 enhanc mode work might even destroy content hard disk tri run window 3.1 . 
what one follow 1 . 
use driver provid double-buff . 
it opinion unbeliev slow smartdriv caus either horribl ineffici double-buff bug smartdriv . 
2 . 
use driver provid vds servic vds stand virtual dma servic . 
this standard support window 3.1 allow bus-mast disk control like 1542 work window . 
after trash hard disk countless time i found follow solut none requir use smartdriv note howev i get occasion pariti error probabl not caus solut might see . 
while follow requir smartdriv use kind disk cach util strong recommend make window run much much faster 1 . 
if aspi4dos.si driver need aspi function control cdrom tape drive two physic hard disk etc . 
add scsiha.si driver config.si file e.g . 
drivercscsiha.si v386 window need v386 option . 
this driver must load low memori load high memori occupi 16-20k . 
as novemb 1992 scsiha.si driver could obtain adaptec bbs 408-945-7727 hope 's still . 
2 . 
if need aspi function aspi4dos.si driver version 3.0 3.0a use aspi4dos.si scsiha.si driver config.si file e.g . 
drivercaspi4dos.si drivercscsiha.si v386 amaz enough scsiha.si driver also load high assum dos 5.0 i would thought would crash system n't . 
i ask adaptec 's technic support said load scsiha.si high fine long aspi4dos.si load low . 
on system not use scsiha.si aspi4do 3.0a would occasion caus window 3.1 crash upon restart exit window addit result corrupt disk cwindows.grp file would corrupt . 
for crash usual occur make differ program progman.ex default window shell vice-versa . 
this reason scsiha.si may necessari . 
i absolut idea scsiha.si necessari version aspi4do earlier 3.0 . 
note mani peopl use aspi4do 3.0 3.0a without scsiha.si seem problem . 
i consid peopl lucki . 
other like sort problem . 
3 . 
in opinion best necessarili easiest solut upgrad aspi4do 3.1 . 
the scsiha.si driver longer need . 
unfortun could get previous aspi4do upgrad adaptec bbs aspi4do 3.1 driver avail adaptec bbs . 
as far i know three way get copi you buy new novemb 1992 adaptec ez scsi driver kit suppos includ aspi4do 3.1 well driver cdrom driver . 
i believ list price around 75 . 
if alreadi copi older version aspi4do suppos contact adaptec upgrad ez scsi around 30 . 
a copi aspi4do 3.1 includ central point pc tool 8.0 msdos . 
note document driver store differ directori . 
note aspi4do includ cdrom driver driver support two hard disk includ . 
this i obtain copi aspi4do 3.1 . 
note howev i get occasion pariti error window . 
in probabl defect hardwar pc caus i upgrad motherboard i found solut . 
howev pariti error occur disk access small definit possibl pariti error driver-rel exampl chang bus onoff time certain disk transfer might caus . 
i ve run various memori test hour time test found problem . 
this problem probabl caus memori margin time requir caus pariti error disk transfer memori test n't find problem problem show disk io . 
howev i 'm mention case n't hardwar problem . 
floppy-controller-bas tape backup devic there two possibl problem use adaptec 1542 floppy-controller-bas tape backup devic colorado memori system jumbo 250 1 . 
tape backupsrestor take long time . 
the tape drive constant start stop start stop etc . 
2 . 
tape oper may errat encount mani tape error . 
this problem might caus defect hardwar 1542 . 
howev i ve heard peopl similar problem i 'm mention case hardwar problem 1542 . 
tape backupsrestor take long time if floppy-controller-bas tape backup devic may adjust adaptec 15401542 bus onoff time best result use tape drive . 
normal tape backup restor tape drive motor continu run occasion paus . 
howev default bus time adaptec 15401542 may caus tape drive motor start stop start stop everi second . 
this caus needless wear tape tape drive howev note dirti tape head defect tape drive also caus make sure tape head clean . 
this also caus tape backup restor take much much longer necessari . 
the problem tape backup use floppi dma transfer data memori tofrom tape drive adaptec use dma transfer data memori tofrom hard disk . 
the floppi dma need feed data tape drive certain rate tape drive fed data quick enough floppi dma tape drive stop rewind bit restart enough data eventu fed . 
the default bus time adaptec realli dma time larg . 
for exampl backup done data transfer hard disk memori memori tape . 
becaus default time adaptec hog memori much much time spent transfer data hard disk memori enough time spent transfer data memori tape drive . 
as result tape drive constant start stop data fed quick enough . 
the solut chang adaptec 's bus onoff time . 
the default factori set 11 microsecond 5 microsecond . 
the bus time need lower 2-4 microsecond . 
this done one two way if aspi4do use n option . 
for exampl i use bus time 4 microsecond mean i use follow line config.si file devicecaspi4dos.si n4 note no space n 4 . 
if n't aspi4do recours tri find program call setscsi.ex difficult find . 
the reason adaptec reason seem want wide distribut . 
i ask someon work adaptec ask upload anywher . 
if anonym ftp access internet could tri use archi hunt copi i believ coupl site . 
if find copi run like setscsi -n4 this adjust bus time 4 microsecond . 
run setscsi.ex without argument reset bus time back factori default . 
note seem use setscsi.ex use aspi4do setscsi.ex crash system aspi4do load . 
i could use setscsi.ex scsiha.si howev . 
do lower bus time 2 microsecond increas 11 microsecond . 
if lower low hard disk throughput sudden drop system feel slower . 
for 4 microsecond work fine . 
this valu may work fine may adjust downward littl . 
onc ve lower bus time tape backup restor run faster . 
also experi bus onoff time option i intent describ unless know . 
bad combin caus pariti error wors starv memori refresh . 
a program call bustifix.ex exist adaptec bbs . 
unless upgrad sinc i last check self-extract archiv contain batch file coupl file . 
this batch file suppos allow one set bus onoff time 15401542 other . 
howev i tri run program 1542a system crash . 
at time i run scsiha.si i n't check see conflict . 
mayb old program work 1542b although doc say work 1542a ? 
errat tape oper mani tape error this problem may may exist . 
although exist system hardwar problem particular 1542 could caus . 
howev i ve heard peopl similar problem i 'm mention case n't hardwar problem 1542 . 
symptom problem persist even clean tape head 1 . 
back tape encount unus sector detect error result abort tape backup . 
2 . 
tape backup work tape compar fail . 
3 . 
the tape drive start stop start stop etc . 
much often . 
unlik above-ment problem tape backupsrestor take long time tape drive start stop everi second kind startingstop occur everi 10-20 second . 
4 . 
fastback plus 3.1 findse tape backup devic . 
other program like central point backup cms jumbo softwar assum cms jumbo 250 tape drive findse tape drive fastback plus 3.1 . 
5 . 
too mani tape read error . 
although i know caus problem i discov use differ floppi control solv . 
a month ago i upgrad motherboard contain integr floppi control . 
as i alreadi floppi control 1542 i initi disabl motherboard floppi control . 
after i decid tri disabl 1542 floppi control use one motherboard . 
when i tape drive cms jumbo 250 reliabl increas dramat fastback plus 3.1 sudden abl find use tape drive . 
i n't know caus hardwar problem 1542 . 
on one hand floppi drive work great attach 1542 seem say noth wrong 1542 . 
on hand tape drive n't work well attach 1542 floppi control work attach differ control could indic hardwar problem 1542 . 
i chang floppi drive cabl conceiv problem cabl . 
i n't know caus realli howev re similar problem might want consid tri new floppi control . 
sound card mani popular sound card play record digit sound typic done use dma . 
like tape drive dma adaptec 's dma conflict sound card dma . 
unlik tape dma conflict usual manifest pariti error system crash pariti error messag . 
what happen data transfer quick sound card adaptec memori refresh occur quick enough caus pariti error . 
usual get pariti error mean hardwar problem system case howev pariti error symptom bad hardwar . 
i ve found pariti error typic occur record digit sound chanc error increas increas record fidel e.g . 
higher sampl rate record stereo record use 16-bit instead 8 etc .. 
like tape drive solut solut lower adaptec 's bus time . 
see section tape drive inform done . 
note howev may may solv problem may reduc probabl pariti error . 
the softwar use record digit sound great affect problem i.e . 
softwar ineffici . 
disk cach speed hard disk amount disk fragment also affect . 
miscellan info this section contain miscellan hint tip rumor . 
much mere inform i ve heard read verifi . 
i believ follow inform correct i 'm sure . 
use risk . 
with qemm 6.00 6.01 6.02 need specifi db paramet e.g . 
db2 unless use aspi4do driver . 
if n't qemm crashhang bootup . 
although qemm manual mention instal program seem detect 1542 present automat add option qemm command line least occur qemm 6.00 instal program i n't test version . 
earlier version qemm probabl need paramet i 'm sure i ve never use version earlier 6.00 . 
if use aspi4do need give qemm db paramet . 
some version 1542 support hard disk one gigabyt size . 
to support hard disk capac 1gb need get new rom bio adaptec . 
i 'm sure still true latest 1542bs sold adaptec . 
to connect cdrom drive 1542 need scsi cdrom drive driver . 
note cdrom drive proprietari interfac non-scsi drive use 1542 . 
you three choic cdrom driver i idea well follow solut work even work follow secondhand inform 1 . 
you buy adaptec 's ez scsi driver packag list someth like 75 . 
if alreadi older adaptec driver suppos upgrad ez scsi around 30 . 
contact adaptec detail . 
the ez scsi packag suppos contain everyth need . 
2 . 
you buy corelscsi ! 
driver packag made peopl make coreldraw ! 
this packag contain cdrom driver scsi tape driver worm driver etc . 
i know list price i ve seen packag sold around 80-90 . 
note corelscsi ! 
come aspi4do driver need . 
if alreadi aspi4do may better get adaptec 's ez scsi instead . 
3 . 
this method obsolet follow driver obsolet adaptec 's ez scsi kit i 'm mention case someon alreadi driver . 
you use driver adaptec asw-1410 kit aspi4do asw-410 kit aspi cdrom driver . 
you get copi mscdex.ex high-level cdrom driver includ asw-410 kit avail sever bulletin board . 
to use scsi tape drive 1542 need softwar know talk scsi tape drive . 
softwar i ve heard like section cdrom drive i idea well follow solut work even work follow secondhand inform 1 . 
central point pc tool 8.0 msdos suppos support larg number scsi tape drive . 
it come scsi driver aspi4do 3.1 well central point backup . 
2 . 
the corelscsi ! 
driver packag contain scsi tape backup program see section cdrom drive detail . 
howev note corelscsi ! 
come requir aspi4do . 
i ve seen advertis sell 1542 three configur 1 . 
1542 scsi control hard disk rom bio . 
2 . 
1542 scsi control wbio adaptec aspi driver . 
3 . 
1542 scsi control wbio adaptec aspi driver corelscsi !
