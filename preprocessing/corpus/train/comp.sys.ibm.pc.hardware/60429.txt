i still want know intrins better ide isa bus come multi-task os 's manag data singl scsi hard drive . 
a scsi control transfer data dma allow cpu request data hard drive continu work control get data move memori . 
ide also use dma techniqu . 
i believ floppi control also use dma ad board also use dma . 
dma big deal noth direct scsi . 
ide dma . 
this 's like te pc at hard disk interfac . 
the control move sector buffer memori control card cpu move data buffer main memori 's need . 
if ide n't work way 's compat . 
heck ide use dma 'd hear kind complaint isa bus system 16m ram work ide drive . 
16m dma address limit isa bus ide dma would troubl . 
btw dma-en signal ide cabl spec last report i heard never implement would requir differ kind ide adapt differ driver .
