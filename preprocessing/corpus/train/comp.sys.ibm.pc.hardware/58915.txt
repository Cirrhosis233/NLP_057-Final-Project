mg i went buy simm recent sale person told mg 9-chip simm 3-chip simm one use interchan mg if use one use type . 
n't believ everyth told . 
i tell mix bank ' ok i ca n't see mix one bank unless differ speed e.g . 
mix 60ns 100ns simm one bank the two differ type chip use . 
assum simm 1mx9 9 bit wide two equival configur . 
the 3-chip simm use two 4-bit wide 4mbit 1m 4-bit nibbl one 1-bit wide 1mbit chip total 9-bit wide 1mbyte the 9-bit simm use nine 1-bit wide 1mbit chip . 
these equival way pin ' simm board . 
at simm interfac act 9-bit wide 1mbyte simm 24191 sorri techi ya . 
mg similar one plug two 1mb simm one 4mb simm gi mg system total 6 meg . 
whi ? ? 
if system support mg 8 meg 8 simm slot i plug 4 4mb simm give mg 16mb ? ? 
that sound correct . 
problem comput take 9-bit wide simm mix differ size one bank . 
whi ask ? 
simpl understand bank . 
assum 32-bit cpu 386dx 486 data bus e.g . 
mechan retriev data memori 32-bit wide comput expect see 32 bit ask data . 
to get bandwidth 32-bit wide motherboard link 4 1mx9 one bit data pariti i ignor simpl explain get 32bit 9-1432 bit that mean simm bank store 14 32 bit wide data . 
if 16-bit bus two 1mx9 simm link togeth get 16-bit wide data reason 286 bank 2 simm wide 32-bit bank 4 simm wide . 
if comput requir 1mx36 e.g . 
32-bit wide data 4 pariti bit use ps2s ast could upgrad one simm time . 
hope messag head answer question simpl . 
i could said becaus i said . ' -rdd winqwk 2.0b0 unregist evalu copi kmail 2.95d w-net hq hal9k.ann-arbor.mi.us 1 313 663 4173 3959
