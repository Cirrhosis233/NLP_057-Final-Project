i think follow come john a . 
johnson someon correct i 'm wrong . 
this probabl longest entir collect . 
so propheci fulfil in consid christian religion judg accord claim import look claim fulfil earlier jewish propheci . 
the scribe matthew perhap eager draw think prophet answer career jesus nazareth . 
as see matthew 's main strategi take various old testament passag often even promis messiah appli circumst new testament . 
we must also bear mind question authent account . 
sinc gospel written least 35 year jesus execut know much happen exact state . 
but purpos analysi take particular claim face valu . 
immanuel we begin cours begin . 
mt 1.21-22 mari bear son joseph name jesus ' mean g 'd salvat save peopl sin all happen fulfil lord spoken prophet isaiah 7.1-16 in day ahaz c . 
750 bce king judah rezin syria pekah israel made war jerusalem capitol judah could quit conquer . 
when hous david i.e . 
ahaz court judah told ... heart heart peopl shook ... 
and lord g 'd said isaiah go meet ahaz .. 
... and lord spoke ahaz prophet isaiah natur say ask sign g 'd lord . 
it deep sheol high heaven but ahaz said i wo n't ask i put lord test then isaiah said hear o hous david . 
is enough weari men must weari god ? 
therefor lord give sign behold young woman child bear son name immanuel mean g 'd us he eat curd honey know refus evil choos good . 
for child know refus evil choos good land two king dread desert ... 
matthew home sentenc ital . 
further hebrew word almah young woman specif virgin but propheci messiah . 
it propheci event happen 750 year later . 
it propheci virgin bethulah mother . 
in short jesus . 
matthew made use vers context tri make fit specif case mari . 
it note want read propheci general manner general one made fit mari . 
mari virgin inde young woman child . 
of cours fit shadi problem . 
jesus thought later christian g 'd walk among men never call name immanuel . 
if christian wish claim propheci jesus becom best cut-and-past propheci ... 
second class propheci . 
not convinc . 
egypt after jesus 's birth bethlehem matthew tell quick elsewher unment excurs egypt wish liken jesus mose . 
this done escap alleg infanticid rampag king herod . 
mt 2.15 ... remain death herod . 
this fulfil lord spoken out egypt i cal-l son what lord realli said . 
hosea 11.1 when israel child i love . 
and egypt i call son . 
the i call peopl went kept sacrif ba'al kept burn incens idol . 
matthew conveni omit rest hosea 's oracl . 
but inde israel call egypt want return . 
this histori . 
jesus certain spoken . 
and draw kind parallel wind jesus flee resist g 'd . 
again propheci convinc matthew probabl hope . 
rachel weep while jesus vacat egypt matthew say king herod sought kill thus order execut young male children . 
matthew write mt 2.17-18 by spoken prophet jeremiah fulfil a voic heard ramah wail loud lament rachel weep children refus consol the refer passag jeremiah 31.15 refer carri israel exil sargon assyria 722 bce . 
rachel ancestor major tribe israel ephraim manasseh said weep descend it metaphor cours sinc rachel live die hebrew even egyptian exil . 
it interest note leah rachel ancestor judean land jesus bethlehem . 
if anyon weep children leah . 
the connexion rachel bethlehem legend buri north citi way ephrath bethlehem as herod infanticid rather unlik event actual occur . 
one never know event mention allud anywher els bibl mention secular record time . 
herod particular unlik reign mani far less evil deed herod care record . 
this might prime exampl event ad jesus 's life enhanc messag church 's gospel . 
becaus whole stori 's similar tale infant mose egypt high like devic set matthew add prophet yet artifici approv jesus . 
it surpris matthew conveni neglect mention rest jeremiah quot . 
the children prophet speak dead exil assyrian empir . 
g 'd comfort weep rachel say children return gather back togeth . 
of cours would suit matthew 's purpos children speak dead good . 
again propheci matthew set even anyon bother check convinc . 
the nazaren we even go next chapter find anoth matthean propheci . 
after leav egypt joseph wife take infant jesus live citi nazareth mt 2.23 ... spoken prophet might fulfil he shall call nazaren first thing notic matthew mention name prophet time . 
second ask he . 
there messian propheci speak nazaren . 
wors propheci period mention nazaren . 
still wors nazaren mention old testament . 
in book judg angel tell samson 's mother judg 13.5 ... conceiv bear son . 
no razor shall tough head nazirit god day birth . 
he deliv israel hand philistin this cours propheci jesus messiah g 'd . 
but best found . 
obvious matthew begun go overboard cut-and-past propheci simpl make . 
bear diseas jesus next goe around heal peopl physic ill disabl . 
mt 8.17 this fulfil spoken prophet isaiah he took infirm bore diseas as expect vers quot isaiah quot context word skew fit christian scheme . 
we is 53.4 sure suffer servant born sick carri pain . 
from read surround passag isaiah know prophet speak present tens collect nation israel jehovah 's chosen servant peopl . 
he speak israelit suffer exil voic gentil nation look upon . 
this imag deepli ingrain jewish ident imag chastis yet cherish israel instrument nation ' salvat g 'd . 
the vers speak israel take sick liter metaphor manifest guilt disciplin . 
they speak servant go around heal peopl . 
notic servant isaiah take sick pain nation individu jew . 
jesus know take diseas onto . 
the vers isaiah propheci someth come rather someth alreadi happen . 
while believ jesus took etern punish hell bear ill heal . 
so someon might want say figur jesus reenact deed israel spiritu aton admit matthew 's parallel miss intend effect . 
silent messiah upon heal multitud common said jesus order keep quiet presum would n't arous attent local ruler . 
mt 12.15-21 this fulfil spoken prophet isaiah . 
behold servant i chosen belov soul pleas . 
i put spirit announc justic gentil . 
he wrangl cri aloud anyon hear voic street . 
he break bruis reed quench smolder wick bring justic victori gentil hope name the isaiah passag quot read is 42.1-4 behold servant i uphold chosen soul delight . 
i put spirit bring forth justic nation . 
we cri lift voic make heard street . 
he break bruis reed quench smolder wick . 
he faith bring forth justic . 
he fail burn dim discourag bruis establish justic earth . 
and coastland await law . 
you see matthew conveni left part passag suit deal jesus . 
christian could never think jesus fail never would light mankind burn dim . 
but servant nation israel inde come end job done . 
when gentil come embrac g 'd longer chosen peopl rather children g 'd . 
also end phrase chang judaic ... coastland await law christolog gentil hope name while origin proclaim torah law jehovah rewrit fit strang doctrin believ name if one doubt servant refer jesus one read whole chapter isaiah 42 hear belov blind imperfect servant peopl rob plunder .. 
so see matthew 's attempt propheci examin crumbl . 
three day three night now come upon propheci suppos utter mouth god jesus . 
he speak crucifixion resurrect . 
mt 12.40 for jonah belli whale three day three night son man heart earth three day three night . 
befor discuss occur necessari know jew understood day . 
as far day name went 24 hour long last sunset 6pm follow sunset 6pm . 
what refer day period light 6am end sunset 6pm . 
thus accord time scale sabbath day began 6pm friday even last 6pm saturday even . 
this jew celebr sabbath daylight portion saturday instead sunday . 
it seem like real miracl christian n't forget saturday inde seventh last day week ! 
thus day night refer togeth 12 hour daylight portion 12 hour night period spoken . 
thus jesus say grave hell otherwis unresurrect three day three night . 
as good book tell us jesus crucifi ninth hour 3pm friday afternoon . 
he put grave sometim . 
then jesus left grave rose dawn call sunday the dawn sabbath . 
what mean jesus use time clariti grave 6pm friday night time 6am sunday morn . 
we could also add littl time 6pm friday sinc bibl specif . 
what mean use jewish time grave one day two night possibl coupl hour one day . 
certain problem jesus predict . 
there absolut way even abl death involv three day three night even use modern time measur . 
we led suspect error anoth one matthew 's littl mistak gospel writer put fals word god 's mouth . 
and matter made predict unconvinc ... 
counter-convinc . 
hear understand jesus tool habit speak vast audienc parabl stori deeper mean could found alreadi one elect chosen understand messag jesus . 
he reason understand parabl one want . 
if peopl understand need bother sinc accept plain messag better . 
matthew say mt 13.14-16 with audienc inde fulfil propheci isaiah say you inde hear never understand inde see never perceiv . 
becaus peopl 's heart grown dull ear heavi hear shut eye would perceiv ear understand heart turn heal the origin isaiah passag part earlier work call ministri . 
this 740 bce israel flourish right fall author assyria . 
isaiah see good time end also vision g 'd call bring reform israel judah . 
is 6.9-13 and g 'd said go say peopl hear hear understand see see perceiv . ' make heart peopl fat make ear heavi shut eye see eye hear ear understand heart turn heal then isaiah said how long lord ? 
and said until citi lie wast without inhabit hous without men land utter desol g'ds take men far away forsaken place mani land . 
and though tenth remain burn like terebinth oak whose stump still stand tree fell the holi seed stump . 
here see realli g 'd caus peopl israel stop listen prophet 's warn reaffirm promis made solomon 's david 's seedlineag . 
if read rest isaiah find done fulfil plan g 'd use israel servant light nation . 
look isaiah 42.18-25 48.20 49.3 we see matthew cut-and-past littl portion isaiah 's vers suit gospel need . 
more alter word make fit peopl n't understand jesus 's stori . 
and see isaiah 's vers propheci rather command g 'd present . 
onc matthew 's propheci fall flat face . 
matthew tri make jesus 's parabl look like prophet approv . 
mt 13.35 ... said noth without parabl . 
this fulfil spoken prophet i open mouth parabl . 
i utter hidden sinc foundat world matthew realli botch . 
he attempt quot prophet psalm . 
ps 78.2-4 i open mouth parabl . 
i utter dark say old thing heard known thing father told us . 
we hide children tell come generat glorious deed lord ... 
as point vers psalm realli come prophet . 
you might also want know earlier copi matthew 's gospel even insert isaiah 's name prophet . 
appar later scribe caught error tri cover . 
perhap signific part matthew alter old testament scriptur . 
as jesus said earlier speak parabl understand . 
the parabl psalm hidden . 
further speak thing known father told us jesus deal thing hidden sinc foundat world inde jesus dealt lot secreci confus . 
this direct opposit parabl psalm . 
no wonder matthew rewrit ! 
and still matthew 's artifici propheci fall flat face . 
but christian rare look . 
matthew 's propheci n't thing christian begin look bad . 
excus littl faith in mt . 
17.14-21 see discipl abl go around cast demon except one case . 
not know epilepsi peopl thought diseas posses demon . 
it wonder discipl unabl dispossess epilept . 
but jesus perhap enlighten report rebuk say n't enough faith . 
this seem strang . 
whi demon special ? 
it seem either true believ faith . 
appar enough faith allow someon move mountain . 
of cours find one day move real mountain . 
no one part sea . 
the miracl charismat speak rumour happen trip mexico faraway place . 
major miracl make old woman 's arthriti feel better sunday morn t.v . 
and god includ jesus alway shroud ancient lore write protect skeptic sacr past . 
they either dead sleep hide heaven peopl rumour immin return great miracl day long gone . 
yet life goe . 
tale mystic stori miracl distant time distant place . 
god use reveal men old day jehovah . 
but silent . 
all theologian give various excus n't get see god anymor . 
we re lazi re zealous enough re sin 's plan put mani demand g'd 's appear right faith will meet g 'd term ... 
yet even pious men seen g 'd . 
you dear reader seen g 'd . 
not liter know true . 
i know 's presumptu bold . 
but search heart know i mean . 
all ve seen religion make peopl feel good content see g 'd . 
they say littl faith merit us see g 'd . 
sometim say see love peopl worship ... 
see live peopl chang ... 
see g 'd thus peopl get lull sleep satisfi turn g 'd everyday sight .

what see world good compass human heart love given taken men women forgiv practis christian atheist alik beauti creat mind man . 
these thing done see . 
but said everybodi littl faith . 
jesus ride ass short accept role jewish messiah king jesus request donkey brought ride jerusalem . 
mt 21.5 this took place fulfil spoken prophet say tell daughter zion behold king come humbl mount ass ass-colt of cours passag quot zechariah 9.9 read littl differ . 
lo king come triumphant victori humbl ride ass ass- colt ... 
command peac nation . 
there n't much differ except zechariah involv one anim ass-colt matthew read poetic word slight differ . 
thus jesus call colt adult ass . 
from matthew 's version get comic pictur divin christ sweat straddl two donkey . 
this could inevit lead theolog proctolog dilemma ! 
we find account written earlier st . 
mark colt call brought jesus . 
this inde fit vers zechariah proper show us matthew attempt use prophet vers bungl . 
now exclud mani respect christian i met i notic christ thought ridden ass situat often revers nowaday ... 
then enter jerusalem templ priest anger peopl youngster call jesus messiah . 
but jesus repli might expect matthew done mt 21.16 have n't read ? 
out mouth babe suckl thou brought perfect prais . ' it like matthew made respons sinc jesus never one point littl prophet thing and sinc might expect quot error seem fit matthew 's track record quit well . 
we might ask jesus matthew have n't read ? 
sourc read psalm 8.1-2 o yahweh lord majest name whole world ! 
you whose glori chant heaven babe infant found bulwark foe still enemi aveng . 
the passag hard need comment . 
there perfect prais spoken psalm prais given g 'd messiah king jesus . 
as mention seem one case matthew 's pen make conveni prophet scriptur . 
yhvh said lord ... 
jesus said ask promis jewish messiah-k descend . 
the jew agre king david . 
but jesus counter quot psalm 110 the lord said lord sit right hand i put enemi feet taken face valu jesus deni necess david descent . 
one assum opposit answer . 
of cours christian answer agre tri make hidden point reveal mysteri divin natur messiah-k . 
it 's tempt believ one christian interest matter investig . 
but problem . 
in jesus 's time psalm thought messiah . 
and easi see david might refer messiah superior . 
we need look scriptur messiah see expect great king bring jew time even better david 's rule . 
of cours jew listen good answer passag could inde refer divin messiah christian worship . 
the problem lie mean psalm error appar sever jew jesus 's time also made . 
one must rememb various faction among jew often result differ expect messiah-k . 
jesus appar one adventist like audienc thought messiah 's advent immin interpret psalm 110 among other messian . 
what problem ? 
psalm 110 liter read yhvh 's utter lord sit right hand i make enemi footstool yhvh send forth mighti scepter zion . 
rule midst foe ! 
your peopl offer freeli day lead host holi mountain . 
you priest order melchizedek forev the word lord often mistaken capitalis christian bibl denot divin lord . 
but hebrew word adoni capitalis exist . 
adoni simpli mean lord generic term would use . 
it use often scriptur refer king g 'd . 
it mere address respect . 
there noth text impli word refer either divin messiah-k . 
that suppos written david certain . 
the titl psalm translat either psalm david psalm david it seem fit assum written court poet david 's coven endors g 'd . 
if psalm written david unlik would talk messiah . 
the idea perfect king descend david present david 's age . 
we extens tale david 's do say none includ prais messiah . 
mani psalm show evid written long david dead time exil g 'd put show favour david 's kingdom hold . 
the descript psalm fit david well . 
david promis g 'd rise power victori enemi success judgement among nation conquer . 
he achiev priesthood common melchizedek righteous king enabl bless peopl . 
it fit . 
we blame problem matthew alon though . 
here artifici propheci allud though use scriptur rather question . 
still event common gospel . 
so let matthew littl easili time . 
it interest note though matthew dress event . 
the earlier gospel mark tell tale jesus simpli speak crowd . 
matthew pharise becam religi competit infant christian target jesus 's question . 
as might expect matthew write event end embarrass pharise . 
such power pen . 
mose jesus had togeth all along ... 
we leav gospel stori matthew momentarili see pseudo-propheci john 's gospel . 
the gospel stori john deserv special treatment seem far remov real event jesus 's career told even matthew . 
but moment look one vers . 
the earli church leader found religion jewish hope messiah king artifici extens origin promis made g 'd . 
when construct histori abraham mose wrote promis land nationhood jewish peopl . 
while accomplish eventu rule king david christian came along later decid would claim fulfil promis . 
but expand promis preach heaven kingdom . 
john 8.56 j.c . 
speak your father abraham rejoic see my day . 
he say glad . 
it would nice tie approv jesus abraham abraham knew noth jesus messiah anyth christian . 
i tri fail find event old testament correspond john 's littl propheci . 
it par cours see st . 
john make old testament back like forerunn matthew . 
mani christian know faith mani foundat fraud surpris still cling . 
the potter 's field we told jesus betray jerusalem one follow juda iscariot . 
matthew write mt 27.5-10 and throw piec silver templ juda depart ... 
but chief priest take silver said it n't law us put treasuri sinc blood money so ... 
bought potter 's field buri stranger ... 
then fulfil spoken prophet jeremiah and took thirti piec silver price price set son israel gave potter 's field lord direct this propheci utter gross bastardis old testament scriptur . 
first matthew made mistak regard name prophet . 
it zechariah utter vers matthew make use . 
zech . 
11.12-13 ... and weigh wage thirti shekel silver . 
then yhvh said cast treasuri lord price i paid . 
so i took thirti shekel silver cast treasuri hous yhvh . 
first vers zechariah deal betray messiah g 'd . 
the deal shepherd like priest chosen serv function presid peopl short g 'd would send judah israel conflict one anoth . 
the word treasuri replac king jame scholar potter precis made matthew 's quot fit better . 
but blatant error . 
the correct translat hebrew inde treasuri also make perfect sens zechariah 's context wherea potter 's field total unrel . 
whether mistransl intent seem beyond specul . 
howev given matthew 's track record one find hard resist notion intent dishonesti . 
of cours matthew would ampl reason alter text . 
the thirti piec silver match juda 's situat christian seem reader will disregard contextu incongru matthew might anoth propheci toss around . 
howev correct translat zechariah direct contradict situat juda high priest . 
the high priest would put money treasuri . 
the worthless shepherd zechariah exact opposit ! 
of cours averag thursday-night bibl student propheci present matthew would taken new testament face valu . 
to matthew 's work convinc enough . 
wine vinegar cast lot then jesus led away crucifi . 
mt 27.34-35 ... gave vinegar drink mingl gall tast would drink . 
and crucifi divid garment among cast lot might fulfil spoken prophet they part garment among upon vestur cast lot first vinegar offer jesus actual common sour wine type roman soldier drank regular . 
we find right jesus die soldier give drink pollut gall . 
jn 19.28-30 jesus ... 
said i thirst a bowl vinegar stood put spong full vinegar hyssop held mouth . 
when receiv vinegar said it finish but matthew seem draw passag prophet one psalm . 
ps 69.20-28 i look piti none comfort i found none . 
they gave poison food lit . 
put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink ... 
add punish upon punish may acquitt thee . 
let blot book live . 
of cours sour wine offer jesus done request drink . 
this inde seem show piti . 
the psalm quot david polit militari enemi . 
it messiah jesus . 
it surpris run problem see jesus psalm ask g 'd damnat crucifi wherea jesus gospel say lk 23.34 jesus said father forgiv n't know ! 
further matthew miss attempt creat propheci gall bitter substanc put jesus 's drink meat psalm stipul . 
with propheci vinegar faulti natur ask what cast lot ? 
this bring 22nd psalm deserv discuss . 
suffic say fact jesus 's cloth divid told great thing . 
it turn happen often felon day . 
as soon see perhap least erron passag psalm appli jesus . 
it inde bring interest question qualiti jesus 's cloth . 
for man remov world possess ownership cloth worthi cast lot rais suspicion . 
the 22nd psalm this psalm attribut david lament condit attack enemi . 
it becom song prais yhvh hope . 
taken context part seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quit well . 
we examin primari passag . 
vers 1-2 my god god ! 
forsaken ? ! 
whi far help far word groan ? 
oh god i cri day n't answer night find rest . 
jesus said cri first sentenc cross . 
this suggest whole psalm realli jesus rather king david . 
of cours rest first stanza fit nice jesus execut . 
jesus pictur complain whole ordeal suppos like lamb led mute shearer inde jesus n't much groan even cross . 
he certain cri day night cross . 
6-8 but i worm man scorn men ... 
all see mock . 
they make face wag head he commit caus yhvh . 
so let deliv ... 
delight this seem fit jesus 's execut pretti well except holi messiah call worm . 
12-13 mani bull encompass ... 
open mouth wide like raven roar lion . 
16-18 yea dog round compani evildo encir-cl pierc hand feet . 
i see bone ... 
they divid garment among cast lost raiment . 
19-21 but yhvh far away ! 
... deliv soul sword life power dog ! 
save mouth lion afflict soul horn wild bull ! 
it would seem quit convinc i 'm sure earli christian father wrote propheci thought . 
unfortun propheci fatal flaw . 
the word pierc realli exist psalm . 
the correct hebrew translat 16 yea dog round compani evildo encircl like lion hand feet ... 
in hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierc differ one phonet charact . 
the word hebrew text liter like lion ka'ari make sens context even fit anim imageri employ psalm writer . 
it conveni would urg christian chang word ka'aru but add need yet artifici weight propheci christian translat chosen . 
while correct translat elimin psalm refer jesus absenc say much honesti translat . 
apart erron vers 16 psalm lend jesus easili . 
vers 20 speak suffer save sword rather cross . 
this natur fit psalm 's true subject king david . 
as side note know crucifixion pierc hand palm rather forearm . 
this n't say much favour tradit thought resurrect jesus show discipl scar palm . 
but fact n't bound religi belief . 
matthew escap culpabl time attempt draw mani direct link psalm lord jesus . 
but psalm like mani other mind gospel writer compil stori interpret jesus 's life death . 
how much scriptur may contribut actual got written question serious repercuss christian theolog . 
it easi see faith fundamentalist event new testament might enhanc scribe eager matthew . 
but less specul simpli investig scriptur matter prophet claim . 
so far said good thing st . 
matthew . 
the refer pierc look lot like jesus 's crucifixion . 
john 's gospel recount written 70 year fact tell us jesus 's execut jn 19.3437 but one soldier pierc side spear came blood water ... 
thing took place scriptur fulfil ... 
the look ve pierc of cours built passag taken blatant context . 
prophet zechariah tell us much nation israel split jerusalem judah go war . 
zc 12.7-10 and yhvh give victori judah ... 
and day i seek destroy nation come jerusalem judah . 
and i pour spirit compass supplic ... 
jerusalem look pierc mourn weep bitter like weep firstborn child . 
john 's attempt make propheci perhap weaker matthew 's attempt . 
matthew least usual excontext one passag . 
john 's error grossli obvious blatant . 
it speak well gospel writer help show prophet aspect religion found . 
reckon transgressor after arrest jesus quick execut claim jewish kingship messiahship . 
accord one version gospel tale jesus get execut along two thiev . 
mk 15.27 and crucifi two robber one right one left . 
and scriptur fulfil say he reckon transgressor here mark tri link jesus passag isaiah 53 servant nation israel . 
the passag messiah one read whole chapter isaiah 53 surround chapter one see servant nation . 
the vers also servant gone past predict come event . 
the servant thought crimin . 
this also happen fit descript jesus . 
had passag realli messiah still clear execut jesus two thiev would fulfil propheci isaiah . 
jesus would fit fulfil whole ministri . 
he consid blasphem troublemak throughout career . 
lock onto singl event rather poor way steal propheci least case see mark could made better analog general comparison . 
mark goe tell us crucifi jesus also revil 15.32 this expect coupl robber . 
of cours later recount st . 
luke decid chang thing . 
luke tell us lk 23.39-43 and one crimin hang rail are n't messiah ? ! 
save us ! 
this certain fit mark 's recount tell peopl crucifi jesus said save ! 
robber . 
but luke goe but crimin rebuk first say do n't fear g 'd sinc sentenc condemn ? 
and inde just receiv due reward deed . 
but man done noth wrong . 
and said jesus rememb come kingdom and jesus answer verili i say today paradis now littl dialogu seem high contriv . 
it stretch imagin bit see pictur one ruffian rebuk fellow crimin eloqu speech . 
we rather strang pictur crimin lament good punish just suffer . 
such man appar nobl principl n't seem like robber . 
we wonder amount theatric creat luke . 
of cours luke 's recount also disagre mark 's . 
luke one crimin revil jesus . 
it easi enough discount discrep account made wish believ part error free word g 'd avenu open . 
this yet anoth exampl writer tri take old testament passag expand reinterpret suit theolog . 
in case embroideri creat embarrass problem seen . 
the end world mt . 
24 now come perhap one extraordinari embarrass passag new testament . 
it found three synopt gospel stori cast unfavour doubt whole theori christian . 
jesus mention destruct jewish templ build discipl ask end world warn . 
the discipl tell us templ 's destruct sign come close age ? 
jesus take care one lead astray mani come name say i christ ... hear war rumour war ... 
must take place end yet . 
for nation rise nation ... 
begin birthpang . 
they deliv ... 
put death fals prophet aris lead mani astray . 
... but endur end save . 
this gospel preach throughout whole world testimoni nation end come . 
so see desol spoken prophet daniel ... let judea flee mountain . 
immedi tribul day sun darken ... 
star fall heaven ... 
appear sign son man heaven tribe earth mourn see son man come ... 
send angel ... 
gather elect ... 
learn lesson fig tree soon branch becom tender put forth leav know summer near . 
so also see thing know he near gate . 
truli i say generat pass away thing take place ... 
but day hour one know angel son father ... 
therefor also must readi son man come hour expect . 
from clear jesus thought world would within lifetim least discipl . 
he tell although n't know exact day hour come thus must readi . 
theologian wet pant panic find way holi error . 
but unfortun jesus made explicit . 
he told discipl generat would still around end particular prepar prepar swept away . 
there resort remov inerr natur bibl said phrase generat shall pass away .. 
realli mean race peopl pass away .. 
of cours word generat use mani time refer exact generat discipl . 
it interest notion god decid learn greek n't learn well enough make clear . 
but . 
quit obvious rest dialogu discipl least suppos live end world . 
the charg mistransl complet blown away look apostl ' respons . 
it becom abund clear rev . 
22.7 1 peter 4.7 1 john 2.18 rev . 
22.20 jesus meant exact said . 
the end near . 
for 2000 year christian rationalis 24th chapter matthew ignor mean altogeth . 
for 2000 year wait execut leader come back hear war rumour war sure he come soon . 
sure he must . 
all must wait . 
can imagin tire he must sit around holi wait right moment spring ? 
so short crucifixion jesus nazareth joshua-ben-joseph die . 
it said three day three day three night three period time three etern second three whatev decid make less troubl seen resurrect glow divin radianc . 
then saviour decid n't best interest new religion stick around therefor disappear sight heaven . 
so stori goe anyway . 
as seen mani thing attribut jesus peopl got around write gospel stori . 
to jesus fulfil propheci scriptur . 
we seen though matter quit shaki . 
but throughout church histori christian held fast faith simpl belief . 
what doctrin object could solv argument brute forc faith forget kept away question .
