what god creat life accord protein code mutabl evolv . 
without delv deep discuss creation vs evolution god creat origin genet code perfect without flaw . 
do evid ? 
if code perfect degrad ever sinc evid favour statement n't ? 
perhap biggest imperfect code full non-cod region intron call interven code region exon . 
an impress amount evid suggest intron ancient origin like earli exon repres earli protein domain . 
is number intron decreas increas ? 
it appear intron loss occur speci common ancestri usual quit similar exon-intron structur gene . 
on hand possibl intron insert later present sever logic difficulti . 
intron remov splice mechan would present unus intron insert . 
moreov intron insert would requir precis target random insert would toler sinc sequenc intron remov self-splic mrna conserv . 
besid transposit sequenc usual leav trace long termin repeat target site duplic found near intron sequenc . 
i serious recommend read textbook molecular biolog genet post theolog argument like . 
tri watson 's molecular biolog gene darnel lodish baltimor 's molecular biolog cell starter . 
rememb question pose theolog context whi god caus diseas newborn ? 
answer likewis theolog perspect . 
it less valid pure scientif perspect differ . 
scientif perspect support evid wherea theolog perspect often fail fulfil criterion . 
i think misread mean . 
i said god made genet code perfect n't mean 's perfect . 
it certain evolv sinc . 
for wors ? 
would pleas cite refer support assert ? 
your assert less valid scientif perspect unless support evid . 
in fact claim parasit diseas perhap import ve thought instanc sex might evolv defenc parasit . 
this view support comput simul evolut eg tierra . 
perhap . 
i thought higher energi ray like x-ray gamma ray cosmic ray caus damag . 
in fact thermal energi damag although usual mild easili fix enzymat action . 
actual neither us know atmospher like time god creat life . 
accord recollect biologist claim life began 4 billion year ago would half billion year earth creat . 
it would still primit support life . 
i seem rememb figur like 2.5 3 billion year ago origin life earth . 
anyon better estim ? 
i 'd replac creat form sinc need invok creator earth form without one . 
most recent estim age earth rang 4.6 4.8 billion year earliest sign life true fossil organ stromatolite-lik layer date back 3.5 billion year . 
this would leav billion year first cell evolv . 
i 'm sorri i ca n't give refer base cours evolutionari biochemistri i attend . 
dominion great feat satan genet engin diseas bacterialvir genet . 
although forc natur select tend improv surviv speci degener genet code tend offset . 
again want true evid suppos degener ? 
i understand scott 's reaction excus far-fetch i know must jest . 
do know pathogen ? 
do know point mutat ? 
do know everyth can come about spontan ? ! ! ! ! ! 
in respons last statement neither . 
you may well believ accept fact know . 
i hope n't forget we evid suggest everyth come spontan . 
do evid conclus ? 
in scienc one believ anyth . 
it healthi sign doubt disbeliev . 
but right path walk take look evid present one 's conclus prior . 
theolog use method . 
therefor i serious doubt could ever come right conclus . 
human dna complex tend accumul error advers affect well-b abil fight diseas simpler dna bacteria virus tend becom effici caus infect diseas . 
it bad combin . 
henc newborn suffer genet viral bacteri diseasesdisord . 
you suppos purpos valid move . 
bacteria virus exist caus diseas . 
they anoth manifest general principl evolut replic save replic degradi . 
we effici method dna surviv replic . 
the less effici method n't make present . 
and last time . 
pleas present evid claim human dna degrad evolutionari process . 
some peopl claim opposit true suppress select thus bound degrad . 
i n't seen much evid either claim . 
but i ask so ? 
where relev discuss answer john 's question ? 
whi genet diseas mani bacteri viral diseas requir babi develop antibodi . 
is god 's fault ? 
origin question i say . 
of cours noth evil god 's fault . 
but explan work fail miser . 
you may right . 
but fact n't know satan respons neither i . 
suppos power evil like satan exist . 
would inconceiv might respons mani ill affect mankind ? 
i n't think . 
he could done much better job . 
pun intend . 
the problem seem satan necessari explain diseas inevit product evolut . 
did i say ? 
where ? 
seem like anoth bad infer . 
actual ve done oversimplifi i said point summari word take new context . 
i never said peopl meant presum god punish get diseas . 
whi i say free moral choic attend consequ . 
if mankind choos reject god peopl done sinc begin expect god protect advers event entrop univers . 
i expect . 
if god exist i expect leav us alon . 
i would also like hear believ choic inde free . 
this interest philosoph question answer clear-cut seem . 
what consequ would expect reject allah ? 
oh i admit 's perfect yet . 
but i 'm work . 
a good librari bookstor good start point . 
what price tea china question i provid answer ? 
biolog genet fine subject import scientif endeavor . 
but explain god creat set life process . 
they n't explain behind creation life subsequ evolut . 
whi behind ? 
and proposit someth support evid . 
this recommend book . 
is need invok behind prime mover ? 
evid ? 
if whole univers come exist without intervent recent cosmolog theori hawk et al suggest peopl still insist ? 
thank scotti fine sage advic . 
but i high motiv learn nitty-gritti detail biolog genet although i 'm sure i 'd find fascin subject . 
for i realiz detail chang big pictur god creat life begin abil chang adapt environ . 
i 'm sorri . 
there evid big pictur need creat anyth capabl adapt . 
it come exist without suprem be .
