but perhap bargain attitud behind differ vision interim stage wrong ? 
for two reason 1 present palestinian isra leadership moder like exist mani year present opportun may last signific period 2 sinc negoti design even attempt resolv conflict attent issu deal desir final status mis- place potenti destruct . 
given propos either side alter temper maximalist approach state ? 
how isra worri desir interim control address provid real interim palestinian self-govern entiti ? 
tim basic problem israel may remain leav occupi territori neither . 
so far isra continu propos remain . 
the palestinian propos leav . 
whi either chang view ? 
it worth point area compromis accomod view seem requir reduct isra presenc . 
israel propos reduct .... 
fact may said negoti . 
tim there seem two percept address . 
the first israel littl trust arab group littl support israel give tangibl asset exchang piec paper expect hope etc . 
the second arab worldpalestinian demand tangibl concess made israel without receiv anyth tangibl back . 
given gap two stanc seem need israel receiv tangibl return expect concess . 
by tangibl meant someth 1 provid israel compar protect land give 2 way ensur arab state palestin account held activ diplomat respons uphold action territori citizen visitor . 
in essenc i believ israel object palestinian statehood would anywher near strong if israel assur new palestinian state would commit co-exist israel held respons all attack israel territori . 
asid rather slant propos could guarante instil ? 
for exampl could guaranteescontrol ad palestinian pisga propos ? 
israel hang larg scare stiff minut let go give land back arab state buffer zone give full autonomi palestinian ani andor all arab parti could would control somehow easili return tradit anti-israel posit . 
the question how realli ensur happen .
