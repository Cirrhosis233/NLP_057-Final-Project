predict . 
although i think bryan murray probabl best gm i ever seen hockey how figur ? ? 
when bryan murray took wing pretti good team contend stanley cup look unlik win . 
now pretti good team contend stanley cup look unlik win . 
a truli great gm would abl make move push team upper echelon nhl mayb win stanley cup . 
a good gm like murray i think murray done great job . 
he 's pick ciccarelli sheppard ysebaert howe coffey riendeau plus depth player without give anyth wing need top prospect . 
all three year . 
has anyon done better ? 
the year took wing n't even make playoff . 
there year half demer ' stint wing ok due demer ' motav skill clutch grab style . 
they n't much talent . 
gerald murray n't respons primeau although i 'm readi admit 's horribl pick . 
they hire draft never made sens . 
his first pick lapoint .
