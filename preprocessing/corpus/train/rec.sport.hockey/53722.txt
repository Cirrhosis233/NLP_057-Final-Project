so dynasti talk n't complet unfound . 
an all-finnishall-swedish team might advantag player would play home half time wo n't adapt foreign countri foreign languag presum play wide-open european variant hockey rather learn north american check game . 
howev free agenc becom factor top scandinavian player still might end play large-market team coupl year way edmonton 's dynasti crumbl late 80s . 
some fring player like draft nhl team exclus talent pool might bit unfair . 
i 'd settl compromis prohibit european team sign north american first two round allow keep top two player . 
after amateur draft open anyon .
