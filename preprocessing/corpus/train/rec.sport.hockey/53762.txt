i also think hard time pittsburgh face final detroit sportswrit predict . 
although i think bryan murray probabl best gm i ever seen hockey how figur ? ? 
when bryan murray took wing pretti good team contend stanley cup look unlik win . 
now pretti good team contend stanley cup look unlik win . 
a truli great gm would abl make move push team upper echelon nhl mayb win stanley cup . 
a good gm like murray maintain team 's success ca n't push next level . 
when jacqu demer brought wing confer final twice year back everyon team give 100 percent littl talent . 
he yzerman bob probert drink problem time coupl decent goaltend hanlon stefan got hot . 
that 's . 
can name one player earlier team even deserv all-star game much less actual got yzerman probert ? 
like petr klima ? 
give break ! 
when face edmonton confer final hard play clear face team simpli superior talent wing . 
that 's could get final . 
also time norri divis still weakest divis hockey get past chicago toronto impress today . 
murray brought score talent wing year ago devellano gm demer coach . 
to name ysebaert kozlov paul coffey made definit posit impact power play especi . 
murray built one talent team hockey present possibl except pittsburgh penguin . 
the wing least five 30 goal scorer i think coupl defenseman 100 game worth playoff experi . 
murray 's one fail unlik gm 's mention definit also good n't get wrong found strong coach motiv team go give 100 percent full 60 minut everi night like last time made cup run . 
when team win lose 's reflect gm coach point origin post . 
if team outmatch oppon term talent lose anyway case year wing struggl indic gm done job build team coach fail motiv . 
if case last run wing made playoff murray came gave oppon hard time beaten easili indic good coach make lack talent . 
all fine . 
i never said murray bad gm . 
i mere said n't best gm hockey- even contend honor . 
if murray great claim- wing would stanley cup now- probabl . 
if great gm claim poor coach claim- would intellig enough hire coach push team next level success . 
but murray averag unspectacular nhl coach pretti good gm none true anyway .
