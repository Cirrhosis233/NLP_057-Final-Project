i think team mvps biggest surpris biggest disappoint year . 
now observ admit lack i opportun see team amount . 
anyway .... 
team mvp surpris disappoint edmonton oiler manson buchberg mellanbi well sinc oiler n't win heck lot game i 'm sure deserv mvp ca n't win without . 
howev i 'd suggest kelli buchberg instead dave manson brutal year pick all-star game notwithstand . 
as biggest surpris i 'd say buchberg higher expect year due breakthrough year last year n't realli rais game . 
my suggest would shjon podein one callup cape breton year . 
he quit far depth chart oiler stabl prospect made big impact team . 
he 12 goal 33 game -1 . 
those decent number third-lin player seem doom minor-leagu oblivion . 
the oiler coach staff liken style john tonelli . 
i think ll full-tim roster next year . 
as biggest disappoint could name player oiler dump lousi product year nichol gilchrist tikkanen even shayn corson mellanbi n't far .
