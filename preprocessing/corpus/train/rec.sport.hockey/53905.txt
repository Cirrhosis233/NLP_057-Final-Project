as pick ottawa pick 1 mean almost 100 alexand daigl go 1 . 
he ll either stay trade montreal quebec . 
imo i would take kariya . 
he alot leadership ncaa far world championship . 
daigl n't show junior team . 
san jose get kariya . 
tampa bay either go russian kozlov i think 's defenseman rob niedemey probabl spelt last name wrong the last name niedermay new jersey 's scott 's last name guess brother . 
but rob niedermay center defenseman . 
i sure shark take kariya . 
they n't say much appar like niedermay victor kozlov along kariya . 
chris pronger 's name also mention . 
my guess ll take niedermay . 
they may take pronger except alreadi mani defens prospect .
