as note anoth thread limit govt problem libertarian face insur limit govern seek becom tool privat interest pursu agenda . 
... 
it failur libertarian ideolog provid reason way restrain action utopian dream . 
you seem say limit govern provid more opportun privat interest use pursu agenda ask libertarian prove not happen . 
while i ca n't offer proof seem pretti damn plausibl govern regul particular area becom tool privat interest pursu agenda area . 
i rather suspect 's sort govern now like becom tool is tool mani instanc . 
just marxism fail specifi pure communism achiev state wither away libertarian frequent fail show weaken power state result improv human condit . 
i suspect improv human condit defin primari goal libertarian would primari goal libertarian govern . 
my impress libertarian primari goal elimin govern coercion except limit case .
