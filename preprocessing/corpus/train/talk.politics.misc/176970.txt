dean.kaflowitz 1 is unborn child human ani point pregnenc ? 
in opinion point pregnanc human . 
you ll defin mean human answer question put . 
a parallel q is person color human ? 
a you ll defin mean human ' to answer irrelev question yes person color human i still n't know mean human mere beg question without respond . 
by tri inject notion race discuss muddi water without ad insight whatev . 
the parallel question could is polydactyl person human ? 
you still answer mean human . 
pleas . 
i would suggest legal preced defin human i.e . 
person whose right protect constitut law someon function brain . 
could cite preced basi definit ? 
while law allow remov extraordinari mean sustain life case brain death lead conclus law defin human . 
howev least defin human tenuous fashion . 
that person whose right protect constitut law for answer question i refer roe v wade subsequ suprem court decis defin extent fetus protect constitut law . 
certain judg concur slaveri violat human right therefor you wo n't answer question instead drag irrelev . 
if want definit human depend vagari law hold solid whatev law may rule provid . 
i would suggest blind faith would like hold shoe foot . 
the brain lifedeath paradigm one i suggest one consist legal definit . 
it clear n't matter whether unborn child right howev point lost . 
more irrelev . 
as larri margoli point law made special except order includ fetus follow version human . 
and point brain death mean determin right live rather die . 
there signific differ . 
what i wonder argument fail feel necessari drag irrelev leav thread start ? 
you got answer question began bait recal made ridicul remark adrienn regard correct chang subject remark discuss substanc . 
if realli want discuss substanc disregard logic substanc order toss silli accuss e.g . 
it realli n't matter .. 
if matter defin human seek substanc ? 
you re go convinc logic person right posit unless appli logic show mean word . 
2 if mother right kill womb pass birth canal ? 
becaus woman right object threaten health within confin bodi remov . 
the side argument would give right fetus would grant adult human . 
if exampl occupi bodi anoth whatev reason whatev mean reason mean irrelev would abl remov remov . 
if remov requir demis i see reason law remov could effect . 
rather examin hypothet thought experi let us examin real though rare situat siames twin . 
if one siames twin surgic remov know caus death bar emerg die anyway murder . 
is ? 
have support assert ? 
furthermor analog complet inapplic . 
siames twin equal claim bodi part common . 
tri . 
what establish equal claim beyond assert ? 
if mere matter came first one kill sinc equal claim ? 
what one motor control ? 
doe establish superior claim ? 
as other point one sacrif depend better chanc surviv . 
again analog fail . 
not preced possess make differ . 
a woman 's womb indisput . 
also i see ignor statement would grant right fetus would grant born human . 
was due inconveni ? 
you see right life is grant adult human sens foetus at some point prior to birth . 
are siames twin ever separ womb ? 
or right assert siames twin i n't even think true state valid analog one exist birth ? 
freivald entir argument failur . 
interest way tri combin two essenti orthogon concept . 
the point murder one siames twin kill regardless status physiolog depend interdepend . 
is ? 
pleas cite preced basi rule . 
it would difficult one siames twin kill insid womb even possibl i doubt case could made premedit negleg . 
note use phrase post . 
you simpli assert thing without support . 
your analog accur assert unsupport . 
tri size . 
it murder one siames twin kill womb . 
there . 
we equal argument . 
but idea illog . 
for one siames twin kill womb would like kill well . 
the system depend life . 
i 'm still struggl see anyth analag fail . 
of cours situat not perfect comparison may well one siames twin deliber initi oppress coersion . 
this clear case unborn child . 
and last statement total non sequitur . 
the comparison far wors give credit . 
are go let assert stand also plan follow reason argument ? 
your argument fantasi island . 
your comparison total failur i demonstr alreadi basi realiti neither legal medic . 
and assert perfect comparison imposs coercion oppress ridicul . 
as i said give analog littl credit failur . 
on one hand start say want take real rather hypothet situat fli siames twin murder one anoth womb coerc oppress womb realiti situat describ way match version . 
as i said decis made regard twin live die situat surviv . 
and furthermor i alreadi said differ equal claim organ claim unequ . 
you seem assert fetus claim woman 's womb . 
when fetus born happen claim ? 
and reason assert claim ? 
3 if parent right choos take respons child law penalti child abandon ? 
this last question irrelev someth non sequitur . 
can establish relev even sens ? 
if point unborn child human parent clear respons toward parent toward children . 
again relev ? 
you establish sens point ignor signific differ fetus born child depend born child transfer anoth parti fetus born child live within bodi anoth human fetus therebi repres potenti often actual harm bodi case one talk.abort particip suffer epilepsi pregnanc repres signific health risk case woman i know chose continu pregnanc spent entir pregnanc confin wheelchair suffer great pain constrict nerv argument argument abort general best argument abort time cours pregnanc again quest common ground . 
most pro-choic peopl i spoken person none pro-abort activist conced child right life point supersed mother 's right except life . 
as often case emot charg issu activist differ outlook mainstream . 
you n't answer question . 
the situat analag . 
the depend born child transfer instantan take time effort . 
incident pro-choic side argu govern make easi parent abandon children state . 
again avoid question . 
depend transfer slow seem think . 
as anecdot evid real human tragedi ampl side . 
i would hate posit mother nyc tell daughter lost arm botch abort attempt . 
yes i 'd hate one tell dr gunn 's children murder religi pro-lif fanat . 
pleas tri stay relev .
