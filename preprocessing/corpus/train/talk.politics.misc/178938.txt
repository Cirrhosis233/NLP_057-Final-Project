a judg deni gm 's new trial motion even though gm say two new wit said occup truck dead impact fire .

how wit tell someon burn truck dead rather unconsci ? 
their testimoni would contradict plaintiff 's charg wit occup move impact indic aliv tri get provok sort sympathet gross burn aliv ' reaction . 
it 's kind scari realiz judg go start deni new trial even new evid contradict fact led previous rule appear . 
or judg decid new wit believ ?

what kind wit ? 
if talk wit accid otherwis direct involv e.g . 
paramed emerg room doctor etc .
