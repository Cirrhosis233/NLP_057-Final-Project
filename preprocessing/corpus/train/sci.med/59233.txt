i recal read somewher youth scienc popular book whyle isotop chang n't normal affect chemistri consumpt heavi water would fatal seed water heavi water sprout . 
doe anyon know ? 
i also heard . 
i alway thought might make good eposid columbo ' someon poison heavi water would n't show chemic test . 
no one els seem know i ll post . 
this topic came sci.physics.fus short cold-fus flap start . 
as i recal done experiment mice . 
they show various ill effect eventu die . 
the reason deuterium exact reaction rate hydrogen due extra mass caus lower veloc boltzman constant mumbl . 
this throw various bit bodi biochemistri kilter get sick die . 
i ve never heard anyon poisen way real life . 
the process take quit . 
if anyon want write book i would imagin would 1 replac signific fraction water bodi heavi water . 
2 wait normal breakdown repair process caus molecul bodi synthesis use deuterium . 
dure process victim would gradual deterior eventu die i imagin would take week poison would ensur signific proport water victim ingest heavi . 
you would get mess symptom doctor would alarm confus . 
whi everi organ bodi sudden begin deterior ? 
if figur poison get heavi water victim hospit could real stori . 
come think 2 would continu even heavi water longer ingest hospitalis might late . 
the detect effect would victim 's bodi fluid would liter heavi . 
water molecular weight 18 heavi water mw 20 . 
thus victim 's weight increas 1 everi 10 bodi water replac heavi water . 
mayb detect occur pathologist lab notic victim 's urin strang dens . 
is medic test involv specif graviti bodi fluid ?
