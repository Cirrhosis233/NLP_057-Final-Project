i want achiev overal throughput rate around 5 megabyt sec larg data transfer . 
around 5 mb . 
i quadra 950 . 
i nubus network card pump data mac memori 8.5 mbs . 
use block-mod transfer i high-spe disk array asynchron pb call achiev 6.8 mbs . 
let 's say transfer go disk buffer network card . 
it enough first transfer data disk buffer transfer data buffer card . 
6.8 mbs 8.5 mbs result overal 3.8 mbs . 
too slow ! 
so i tri follow scheme for n-megabyt transfer step 1 load 1st mb disk buffer . 
step 2 asynch send 1st mb card load 2nd mb disk buffer . 
step 3 asynch send 2nd mb card load 3rd mb disk buffer . 
... 
step n asynch send n-1 mb card load nth mb disk buffer . 
step n1 send nth mb card . 
even though code appar execut card transfer asynchron card use mac cpu it use buffer tho ' step 2 n take long two transfer execut one anoth . 
so improv rate . 
whi ? 
is mac ram dual-port ? 
so nubus card disk driver access data time . 
is problem two devic card disk driver use bus mac ram ? 
is anyth i ?
