my advisor decid get mac lab fund . 
the consensus lab realli need lciii decid want centri 610 . 
the lack fpu machin price struck make worth less lciii i suggest get iivx instead . 
it seem heavili expand peopl iivx 's think ? 
they seem like good machin i like nubus slot case ultim decid want work video .... 
the iivx ... lciii perform centri 610 price . 
the reason get iivx realli need full-siz nubus slot . 
keep mind 610 support appl monitor option ethernet . 
this lessen n't elimin need nubus card . 
and unless re run fpu-intens softwar 610 blow door lciii iivx . 
the lciii hand suffici peopl great price . 
if n't guess i find halv bus clock iivx 32mhz up vs . 
16mhz bus through bad thing i hope appl never .
