i believ goe go 680060 powerpc pentium 680040 486 680030 386 680020 286680000 in resent articl one macmag i think 50mhz 030 acceler slight slower 25mhz 040 accel . 
but use system design 030 . 
so it stand reason system design 040 ie quadra would better . 
so overal i 'd figur 040 030 2.5 . 
along line new powerpc stuff suppos run system level fast quadra system 8 whatev allow 3 time speed 040 powerpc base system . 
wait 680060 .
