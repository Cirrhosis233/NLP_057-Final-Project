i believ appl patent region featur quickdraw . 
a mac clone would implement region . 
this appl 's comment believ possibl make mac clone without infring patent . 
they may patent like . 
appl patent implement region presum includ intern data structur never offici document appl . 
appl patent concept region . 
i 'm guess either nutek reverse-engin appl 's intern data structur region i dunno would hold court came data structur . 
if 's latter wo n't abl draw pict file contain region . 
besid pict file n't mani place region store disk . 
quicktim movi perhap ? 
as long region n't store disk transfer mac nutek clone vice versa n't matter nutek use complet differ intern data structur . 
i rememb read appl also patent adb hardwar nutek clone would therefor lack adb port . 
what patent appl mac ?
