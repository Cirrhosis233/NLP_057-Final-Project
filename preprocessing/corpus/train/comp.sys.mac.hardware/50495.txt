whether drive hook comput lps240 make disk seek nois everi 20 second . 
this consist continu lomg drive power . 
even i disconnect drive comput drive activ continu 20 second interv . 
someon tri tell drive thermal recalibr . 
not know bean intern physic work lastest disk drive technolog .... 
i guess i might believ anyth . 
what scoop standalon drive activ everi 20 sec ? 
i comment thermal recalibr general . 
some new drive perform order increas overal integr data write . 
basic firmwar instruct actuat perform test see data track within certain physic toler sinc media heat cool track drift inevit drive monitor . 
this becom especi critic high record densiti use primarili large-capac mechan seem find way smaller drive way boost drive 's long-term reliabl mtbf rate . 
i first becam awar thermal recalibr point techniqu conflict prolong write time digit say audio video hard disk . 
some manufactur explicit state drive thermal recalibr not use applic prolong disk write . 
hope help .
