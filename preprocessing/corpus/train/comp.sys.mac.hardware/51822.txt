in mac price list i ve seen everi c650 messag fpu option . 
i know ve discuss newsgroup c650 fpu built except 480 configur . 
whi would unclear issu price list ? 
i think most fault peopl write literatur price list confus . 
sinc two possibl processor configur one n't fpu seem option even though realli n't . 
i 'm plan buy c650 8230cd pretti soon i 'm get confus whether come fpu . 
well allow end confus . 
the c650 onli come lc040 base 480 configur . 
if get configur get fpu . 
whi say option 's built ? 
good question . 
i wonder sinc feb . 
10th . 
if get centri 650 cd configur get mac 68rc040 processor built-in math coprocessor support . 
my understand option fpu refer option purchas centri 650 480 without fpu or one configur with fpu . 
this possibl option someth suppos abl request want . 
what appl done given buyer choic configur option . 
appl offer upgrad non-fpu system becom fpu system . 
and unclear whether 040 processor non-fpu system 68lc040 replac 68rc040 suppli anoth vendor . 
this unclear . 
in fact appl includ rom machin lc040s code recogn presenc full 040 's fpu use . 
therebi make upgrad easi switch chip . 
you pop lc040 pop full 040 . 
appl send memo one point sate centri 610 onli come non-fpu 68lc040 processor can not upgrad support fpu pin configur two chip appar match swap one anoth accord appl 's memo . 
they ? 
i think i would double-check . 
it state countless time newsgroup two centri hardwar design lc040 full 040 pin compat c610 upgrad full 040 .
