as i said i know multisess cd-rom necessari photo .. 
but writabl cd-rom drive second session need one ? 
if write second time cd need multi-sess capabl read second session . 
whether photo data whatev . 
here simplifi way look the first session directori structur burn track . 
the second session newer directori structur first directori still exist chang add . 
so put normal ' drive look first directori think found data . 
multisess kindof mean drive look last directori written disc older system look the ' directori take multipl directori account .
