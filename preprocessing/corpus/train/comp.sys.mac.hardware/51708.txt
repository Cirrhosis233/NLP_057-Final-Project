i 'm sure intel motorola compet neck-and-neck crunch-pow given clock speed rank follow 1st 6th 486 68040 386 68030 286 68020 040 486 030 386 020 286 while re follow fit list 68060 pentium powerpc 060 fastest pentium first version powerpc somewher vicin . 
and clock speed doe doubl clock speed doubl overal processor speed ? 
and fill 's no . 
comput speed part depend processorclock speed . 
memori system speed play larg role video system speed io speed . 
as processor clock rate go speed memori system becom greatest factor overal system speed . 
if 50mhz processor read anoth word memori everi 20ns . 
sure put 20ns memori comput cost 10 time much slower 80ns simm . 
and rough 68040 twice fast given clock speed 68030 .
