now ? 
i doubt trapdoor skipjack . 
but never know . 
and i doubt nsa would promot mass market chip could n't compromis . 
ergo nsa capabl compromis probabl brute forc keysearch engin complex skipjack . 
look spec . 
whi i bet thousand littl chip chug away crypto buster ... 
mayb even ten thousand . 
complex ? 
not much 3090 . 
how mani machin fit fort mead ? 
i think pgp2.3 256 bit idea key ... 
thousand ? 
ten thousand ? 
do arithmet pleas ... 
skipjack 280 possibl key . 
let 's assum brute-forc engin like hypothes des 1 microsecond per trial 1 million chip . 
that 's 1012 trial per second 38000 year 280 trial . 
well mayb get chip run one trial per nanosecond build machin 10 million chip . 
sure 3.8 year solut . 
idea use 128-bit key . 
shall i bother calcul ? 
hint multipli 3.8 year 2128-80 . 
and ca n't idea speed key setup take much long . 
i would n't surpris case skipjack though 's way know yet . 
des use xor 's feasibl mid-70 's technolog . 
modern chip lot .
