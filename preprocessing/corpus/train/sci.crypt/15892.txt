can someon tell hardwar compress need run digit speech 14.4k ? 
i think i ve heard 's . 
let say 8 bit sampl . 
would raw data correspond sampl rate usabl ? 
if fanci compress need ? 
as far i know isdn call swissnet 's plug 's 8 bit 8000hz give one channel 64kbitsec i guess go sampl rate 6000 hz want qualiti analog-lin . 
anybodi know compression-algorithm -factor voic i ve post info celp code sci.crypt . 
look like squeez speech 4000bps fast enough comput like sparcstat newton acorn risc machin this drop bandwidth low figur 's feasibl run speech tcpip run top slip v32bis modem . 
not let us run point point encrypt speech ll let us run speech intern internet no-on stop us get heavi regul . 
the thought administr realis would probabl scare shitless . 
now cours trick develop defin standard protocol internet speech damn fast allow anyon feel brave inplement custom handheld hardwar well us hack workstat . 
should n't difficult . 
the celp stuff standardis use tcpip stream protocol allow silenc use catch net lag also avoid send data silenc ie 's wise synchronis real-tim end net delay would add big voice-lag as i 'm go press ahead tri stuff soon i get sparc back loan buy necessari microphon . 
it ll save fortun call friend texa everi night whether encrypt you know sure someon work . 
who ? 
it 's obvious n't exist alreadi ? 
i ve seen netphon sun n't celp compress restrict ether connect .
