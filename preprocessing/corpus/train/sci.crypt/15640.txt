thousand ? 
ten thousand ? 
do arithmet pleas ... 
skipjack 280 possibl key . 
we n't yet know 80 bit count . 
that n't worri re go cheat someth get caught . 
and key size one thing verifi extern . 
feed lot random keyinput pair chip tri flip random key bit see happen output . 
we alreadi know happen half output bit vari averag 1-bit key chang input chang . 
if build weak cryptosystem might case bit much less power other sens enter encrypt late game . 
by contrast des design use key bit earli possibl 50 output chang rate appear earli round 5 . 
again though i n't think nsa go cheat crude re like get caught . 
consid cryptosytem start xore bit 23 47 use either bit except xor . 
this system make earli use everi bit . 
exhaust key search would 279 key search . 
your test vari singl key bit would n't turn anyth interest . 
rememb ve promis let committe outsid expert see cryptosystem design . 
if assum someth des-lik bias subkey generat schedul stick like sore thumb . 
the algorithm i suggest would stick like sore thumb i 'm sure i could design system subtl key redund well-hidden would still make exhaust key search take far less 280 encrypt . 
i n't believ claim real keysiz verifi extern .
