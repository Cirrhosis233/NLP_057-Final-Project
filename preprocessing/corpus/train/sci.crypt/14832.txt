archive-nam ripemattack last-upd 31 mar 93 210000 -0500 some possibl attack on ripem this live list potenti weak keep eye open use ripem secur electron mail . 
it go great detail almost certain exhaust . 
obvious mani weak weak cryptograph secur mail general pertain secur mail program ripem . 
post month varieti news group followup pertain specif ripem go alt.security.ripem . 
cryptanalysi attack break rsa would allow attack find privat key case could read mail encrypt sign messag privat key . 
rsa general believ resist standard cryptanalyt techniqu . 
even standard key 516 bit ripem long enough render impract bar huge invest hardwar breakthrough factor . 
break des would allow attack read given messag sinc messag encrypt des . 
it would allow attack claim . 
des 56 bit key thus could conceiv compromis brute forc suffici hardwar agenc money devot simpli read one messag . 
sinc messag differ des key work messag would remain high . 
key manag attack steal privat key would allow benefit break rsa . 
to safeguard encrypt des key deriv passphras type . 
howev attack get copi privat keyfil passphras snoop network packet tap line whatev could break whole scheme . 
the main risk transfer either passphras privat key file across untrust link . 
so n't . 
run ripem trust machin prefer one sit right front . 
ideal machin home mayb offic nobodi els physic access . 
fool accept bogus public key someon els could allow oppon deceiv send secret messag rather real recipi . 
if enemi fool intend recipi well could re-encrypt messag bogus public key pass along . 
it import get proper public key peopl . 
the common mechan finger assum oppon compromis router daemon finger given fair amount trust . 
the strongest method key authent exchang key person howev alway practic . 
have peopl vouch sign statement contain key possibl although ripem n't featur automat pgp . 
ripem generat check md5 fingerprint public key key file may exchang via separ channel authent . 
playback attack even oppon break cryptographi oppon could still caus difficulti . 
for exampl suppos send messag mic-on pem mode provid disclosur protect alic say ok let 's your oppon intercept resend bob messag authent tell . 
of cours may interpret entir differ context . 
or oppon could transmit messag recipi much later figur would seen differ later time . 
or oppon could chang originator-nam regist public key send messag hope recipi send return mail indic perhap even quot ! 
unknown messag . 
to defeat playback attack plaintext messag includ indic sender recipi uniqu identifi typic date . 
a good front-end script ripem automat imho . 
as recipi sure originator-nam header sender indic within plaintext realli recipi messag old one . 
some also autom . 
the author faq made modest attempt autom process generat check encapsul header program includ standard distribut util directori . 
local attack clear secur ripem greater secur machin encrypt perform . 
for exampl unix super-us could manag get encrypt mail although would take plan effort someth like replac ripem execut trojan hors get copi plaintext depend 's store . 
in addit link machin run ripem extens . 
if decrypt ripem remot machin connect via network wors yet modem eavesdropp could see plaintext probabl also passphras . 
ripem execut system trust obvious . 
in extrem case ripem use machin total control nobodi els access care examin softwar known free virus . 
howev 's real trade-off conveni secur . 
a moder cautious user might use ripem unix workstat peopl access even root access increas secur keep privat key static link cours execut floppi disk . 
some peopl keep ripem multi-us system dial insecur line download messag system perform ripem decrypt . 
howev secur provid mechan somewhat illusori sinc presum type cleartext password log ve given away store sinc attack log instal trap account steal privat key next time use less insecur line . 
this like remain situat long system use rather quaint mechan cleartext password authent . 
i find nice put brief statement care i manag secur arrang .plan next public key potenti correspond awar level precaut place . 
some peopl use two key short one care manag ordinari use longer one treat greater care critic correspond . 
untrust partner attack ripem 's encrypt ensur person privat key correspond public key use encrypt data may read traffic . 
howev someon key get messag may alway make whatev kind transform wish . 
there exist cryptograph barrier recipi say take encrypt messag convert mic-on messag sign readabl anyon although ripem provid function . 
inde latest pem draft i seen specif state transform possibl allow forward function work .
