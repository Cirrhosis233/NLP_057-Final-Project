the cryptograph algorythm must kept secret privat individu could make clipperclon could transmit messag fed would readi access . 
not necessarili . 
i ve think chipschem provid real secur must sort key exchang either use public-key encrypt scheme use key exchang scheme like diffie-hellman . 
if 's out-of-band transmiss share session key protect band eavesdrop ? 
if phone compani onlin central author generat session key send user 's point go troubl complic key-depositori ? 
just ask phone compani copi session key call . 
now 's probabl practic user keep onlin copi everi public key use anyon anywher right ? 
so probabl way get key verifi . 
this might digitally- sign chip manufactur copi public key unit store unit . 
it might also onlin directori access everyon 's public key . 
this would introduc anoth weak secur scheme cours . 
presum n't use design key ca n't get verifi connect standard chip . 
it might use modifi chip would allow use either origin publicpriv key pair key pair verif scheme . 
unfortun would allow call peopl establish secur communic ....
