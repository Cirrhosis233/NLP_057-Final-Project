how govern tell encrypt method one use without abl decod traffic ? 
i.e . 
in order accus use unauthor strong encrypt techniqu would take key escrow run ciphertext draw blank . 
i think also . 
it 's quit possibl system transmit clear serial number devic use . 
that way start tap get serial number use warrant first tap get key . 
if tap someon 's appar use encrypt n't find prefix ll assum 's un-author encrypt scheme . 
from limit detail releas far it seem clipper chip system must employ sort public key cryptographi . 
otherwis key manag problem inher symetr cipher would make system unwork . 
it probabl sort public key exchang take place start call . 
that would identifi privat key data base ? 
this mean either nsa develop non rsa public key algorythm fed decid subsid pkp rsadsi . 
the former rather excit posibl sinc keep algorythm secret make chip impliment wide avalib except hard . 
if fed forc make aval order gain public accept could break rsa 's stranglehold public key crypto u. . 
as impress whole scheme it seem instead tri ban strong crypto tri co-opt . 
their content need keep algorythm secret protect secur key registr suggest possibl inher weak algorythm . 
more like dont want anyon construct black market devic dont key regist . 
anyon els notic qa session talk releas key peopl proper autior care danc around state key simpli supeona . 
they seem tri keep open posibl obtain key without court order even though tap phone line requir one . 
also pick implicit threat eith accept ll ban strong crypto outright ? 
i dont trust plan plan oppos legal way possibl .
