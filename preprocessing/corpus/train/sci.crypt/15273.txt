i heard solut sound good . 
then i heard folk experienc time 30-60 second run reasonably-configur workstat . 
i 'm will add much delay someon 's login process . 
my approach etherfindcompress skip 10k take second two run . 
i 'm consid write be-al end-al solut launch md5 simultan tri suck bit net net sit so idl ca n't get 10k compress md5 finish use md5 . 
this way i could guarante good bit determinist upper bound login time still common case login take coupl extra second . 
53 second hash 20m core i bet i know sourc inform ! . 
no 's accept 's part login process . 
but go use network traffic sourc pseudo-random inform right thing pass cryptograph hash function compressor . 
asid fact run faster give better result think cryptograph hash function distil random . 
someth along line etherfind -t -x -n dd bs1k count10 2devnul md5 trick . 
-t give timestamp lack -u make sure dd get ten line oppos ten k . 
the take coupl second lightly-load ethernet .
