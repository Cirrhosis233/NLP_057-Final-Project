can someon tell hardwar compress need run digit speech 14.4k ? 
i think i ve heard 's . 
let say 8 bit sampl . 
would raw data correspond sampl rate usabl ? 
if fanci compress need ? 
note i cabl freak i might complet misunderstood said . 
also math frequent note wrong ll better check calcul . 
i assum 14.4k mean 14.4k bit . 
so assum one start one stopbit protocol overhead effect number byte per second 1.44k . 
let 's also assum want transmit speech stereo send 1440 samplessec . 
this correspond nyquist frequenc 720 hz low especi think 8-bit low qualiti sound . 
furthermor da convert probabl present signal cut 720 hz instead alia higher frequenc . 
although definit build filter overcom problem . 
on hand speech easili compress . 
for exampl could form power spectra could simpli band-pass filter linear fourier transform . 
it wo n't cd qualiti sound ll discern . 
the power spectrum method good respect . 
i program softwar compressor compress rate 90 relat error due linear less 5 common . 
although i must say music sound speech . 
have fun .
