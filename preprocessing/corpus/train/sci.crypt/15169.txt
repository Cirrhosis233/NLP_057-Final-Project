this came i decid configur mit-magic-cookie-1 secur x11r5 . 
for work need stick bit intrud ca n't guess file readabl x client applic read . 
they pass bit back server want establish connect . 
... 
what i settl grab bunch traffic network . 
basic i ran etherfind -u -x greater 0compress skip 10k output grab bit . 
as best i tell bit expect reason uniform distribut quit unguess intrud . 
for applic encrypt real-tim clock valu secret key . 
for good discuss cryptograph good random number generat check draft-ietf-security-randomness-00.txt internet draft avail local friend internet draft repositori . 
a reason sourc random output cryptograph hash function e.g . 
md5 fed larg amount more-or-less random data . 
for exampl run md5 devmem slow random enough sourc random bit bound 128 bit entropi ten hundr megabyt data modern workstat 's memori fair amount system timer io buffer etc .
