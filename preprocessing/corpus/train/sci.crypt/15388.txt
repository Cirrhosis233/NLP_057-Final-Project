the reason wo n't work cours hard anyon one consum equip encrypt use wiretap chip . 
econom i 'm afraid . 
howev ... 
get 2kcps throughput internet even bottleneck v32bis modem . 
when get isdn ha ha ha new nren might trivial run compress speech tcpip connect internet . 
perhap start think standard keep voic internet compat everyon side-step clipper stuff use internet phone call futur 12 joke
