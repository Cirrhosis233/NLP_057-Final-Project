thousand ? 
ten thousand ? 
do arithmet pleas ... 
skipjack 280 possibl key . 
we n't yet know 80 bit count . 
that n't worri re go cheat someth get caught . 
and key size one thing verifi extern . 
feed lot random keyinput pair chip tri flip random key bit see happen output . 
we alreadi know happen half output bit vari averag 1-bit key chang input chang . 
if build weak cryptosystem might case bit much less power other sens enter encrypt late game . 
by contrast des design use key bit earli possibl 50 output chang rate appear earli round 5 . 
again though i n't think nsa go cheat crude re like get caught . 
rememb ve promis let committe outsid expert see cryptosystem design . 
if assum someth des-lik bias subkey generat schedul stick like sore thumb . 
the committe run lot test retain output . 
this verifi later chip . 
and yes civilian communiti least secur storag facil i n't think even nsa get without notic fort mead get transport work . 
oop i n't think i suppos talk ... 
the committe member even retain secur copi code two halv xor togeth recov program ... 
serious i think problem whole scheme . 
but peopl invent n't stupid ve crypto game smoke-and-mirror game far longer us . 
they re go lie way detect easili sinc credibl thing use sell system . 
if ve lie civilian committe one believ absenc back door . 
if ve lie key size one believ n't copi program disk u key . 
if ve lie obvious aspect strength cryptosystem one believ escrow agenc n't cahoot . 
that n't say n't lie thing anyway . 
and i 'm certain claim nsa ca n't build cryptosystem back door committe ca n't find look long took folk believ s-box n't sabotag . 
it 's entir possibl committe releas ambigu report reason . 
but 's subtl point i.e . 
one ca n't explain senat .... 
anyway look like key escrow arrang smoke mirror cover way nsa regener key transmit serial number . 
i n't like unit key generat process better . 
howev s1 s2 suppos control escrow agent . 
if ca n't trust keep seed valu secur ca n't trust keep half-key secur . 
i still n't know s1 s2 chang . 
i thought i seen someth constant i reread den 's technic inform post n't say anyth one way .
