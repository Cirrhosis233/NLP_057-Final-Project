mr decenso spite requir scholar opinion hang juda reject scholar opinion scholar rephras scholar opinion subject ... know matthew hang act probabl record death . 
although 's possibl plausibl fell hang hit rock therebi burst open i longer assum case . 
therefor contradict . 
matthew say juda die result hang ? 
most scholar believ iprob .. ? 
i quot show i high regard scholar ' explan look text initi ca n't assum juda die . 
it howev high probabl . 
also noth greek suggest success failur . 
it simpli mean hang oneself . 
actual research greek word apacgw find denot success . 
those scholar inde excel reason assum suicid success . 
as i point i recent check sever lexicon greek english lexicon new testament louw nida robinson 's greek english lexicon new testament greek english lexicon new testament grimm word studi concord tynsdal a greek english lexicon new testament earli christian write bauer-arndt-gingrich the new analyt greek lexicon perschbach a coupl simpli state hang oneself coupl explicit state apacgw mean specif kill hang a coupl also note mean one root word apacgw strangl throttl choke pretti much invalid guy suggest david joslin juda hung upsid . 
one best refer though robinson 's greek english lexicon new testament state translat gave root word liter translat relat greek word use root also present specif exampl word greek literatur give context . 
the word apagchw two root word gchw strangl root root word apo mean liter away this root word includ word denot transit . 
it mean transit place eg greek word apagello mean send messag . 
apo also denot chang state specif chang life death . 
robinson specif make comparison word apokteiuo mean kill in liter mean word apacgw mean throttl strangl put way implicit denot chang life state ie away life death . 
so word apacgw mean hang specif denot death well . 
thus robinson quit specif state mean hang oneself end one 's life hang he note use apacgw homer odessi 19230 denot context . 
he present exampl apacgw use explicit mean suicid hang now sinc perfect good word strangl without ad denot death insist bibl written god everi word precic correct stuck complet mean apacgw ie sinc word apacgw use death denot result . 
by way i note mr decenso also present exampl apacgw in septuagint greek translat ot use time jesus 's use 2 samuel 1723 now ahithophel saw advic follow saddl donkey aros went home hous citi . 
then put household order hang die buri father 's tomb notic state ahithophel hang gr . 
sept . 
apagcho explicit add die . 
here doubt result . 
in matthew explicit told juda die . 
note mr decenso say septuagint translat hebrew greek shown origin mean hebrew ie hebrew say die thus whether simpli echo greek . 
it also point regardless ad die correct translat would still apacgw man inde die strangul redund correct . 
further evid septuagint repeat rewritten reedit includ version contradict edit even necessarili execut greek . 
thus i sure use septuagint stand paragon ancient greek . 
so realli need prove point mr decenso exampl ancient greek someon commit apacgw surviv . 
otherwis i would see simpli make worthless assert without correspond evid . 
now i would note mr decenso everytim i go way research one appar contriv exegisi i pretti much find fals . 
thus i think go add text someth sourc clear say better explicit greek histor sourc justifi . 
by way mr rose 's statement tree around potter 's field there still tree around ledg rocki pavement bottom . 
unless mr rose show tree two thousand year old 2000 year old stump 2 thousand year old descript area mention tree inappropri assert present placement tree prove locat tree two thousand year ago thing chang . 
now argument ie money juda use 30 silver as second question mr decenso ask could sure money juda purchas land inde betray rather sourc . 
i would point act specif mention reward iniqu act 118 also specif mention act iniqu talk ie act 116 ... concern juda guid arrest jesus . 
now i would point bibl describ act iniqu immedi discuss reward iniqu would rather inan suggest action iniqu one discuss notic vers 16 word iniqu use . 
rather state juda becam guid arrest jesus . 
but writer did not stop ... vs . 
17 number us obtain part ministri what part juda play ministri ? 
true peter author act specif call juda ' betray iniqu matter neither john specif call juda ' action iniqu either . 
further john 1329 say juda took money box rather said some thought juda money box jesus tell buy need feast give someth poor so receiv morsel immedi went night note said juda left say took money box . 
thus i see explan still seem would choos unproven iniqu mention anoth author differ book written differ time iniqu explicit mention author act . 
i find forc contriv . 
of cours particular argument becom moot sinc seen evid apacgw mean suicid . 
you see sinc juda ' hang success could spent money mention john 1329 matthew mark explicit say betray high holi day ie passov thus could spent money kill next day . 
thus money bought field blood would 30 piec silver of cours got 30 piec silver night well thus could n't spent either . 
oh dear i believ hous card com . 
mayb point discuss whether jesus crucifi friday saturday part argument juda . 
by way prophesi potter 's field came ie mention matthew say pleas done studi death remind discuss . 
i remind discuss . 
it 's part vers discuss i wish would quit procrastin sidestep issu . 
later dave butler a wise man proport belief evid .
