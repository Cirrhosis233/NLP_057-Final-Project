hi ... 
i 'm religi guy dont take kinda flame thanx advanc i want know mani differ version bibl ? 
there version bibl i read front page say .... contain inaccur data inconsist thanx advanc ... 
shaz .... 
i 'm sure quit mean mani differ version . 
the primari distinct version see today style translat . 
it 's pretti unusu see signific differ mean . 
there differ under text . 
that 's print manuscript copi hand . 
slight differ result . 
there enough manuscript around scholar pretti good job recreat origin uncertainti . 
fortun general level minor differ word . 
there someth like 3 4 place whole sentenc involv recent discoveri older manuscript i n't think 's much uncertain case . 
as far i know christian believ process copi manuscript process translat free error . 
but i also n't think 's enough uncertainti establish text translat much practic effect . 
whether bibl contain inaccur data inconsist hot topic debat . 
mani christian deni . 
some accept though would say inaccuraci involv detail n't affect faith . 
but noth multipl version . 
the suppos inconsist found version . 
i 'm surpris find refer titl page though . 
what version talk ? 
i ve refer major scholar translat . 
these get referenc post elsewher . 
there certain edit kind less wide accept . 
this includ everyth reconstruct combin parallel account singl narrat edit omit materi editor object reason . 
the copyright bibl long sinc expir noth stop peopl make edit whatev wierd thing want . 
howev edit wide use care prepar group scholar varieti background lot crosscheck . 
i could imagin one lesser-known edit claim fix inaccur data inconsist . 
but 's edit 's wide use . 
the wide use one leav text . 
weeeeelllllll almost . 
it 's alleg translat fudg word two minim inconsist . 
becaus translat exact scienc alway go differ opinion word best i 'm afraid .
