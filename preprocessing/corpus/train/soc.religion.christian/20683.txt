anoth answer god sourc exist . 
this sound much better i tempt ask doe god himself exist ? 
if god sourc his exist mean he term human time alway exist . 
but sourc exist . 
this argument sound like god exist meta-exist his meta-exist perspect he creat exist . 
i think actual nonsolut mere twist word . 
alway exist sourc exist be problemat . 
but put be sourc exist includ one 's would mean god came noth concept alien christian theism . 
it better understand classic concept necessari conting exist . 
god exist necessarili alway . 
god creat conting be . 
this coher solut exist long concept god coher . 
the best answer i heard human reason incap understand question .
