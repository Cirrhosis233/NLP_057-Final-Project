mike walker if use standard formula fulli god fulli human i 'm sure object say jesus human . 
i think usual analysi would sin part basic definit human . 
it 's consequ fall . 
jesus human fallen human . 
clh i differ moder . 
i thought whole idea god come earth live one us subject sin death one consecr prayer book common prayer 1979 put jesus tempt succumb . 
if sin part basic definit human jesus fulli human nicea would subject sin resurrect lose mean encount human power sin . 
to distinguish human fallen human make jesus less like one us time need . 
these issu get mighti subtl . 
when see peopl say differ thing 's often hard tell whether realli mean serious differ thing whether use differ terminolog . 
i n't think 's question problem nestorius i would agre say christ human form without real human natur heret . 
but i 'd like bit wari copt armenian etc . 
recent discuss suggest monophysit posit may far orthodoxi mani thought . 
nestorius extrem repres one two major school thought . 
more moder repres regard orthodox e.g . 
theodor mopsuestia . 
my impress modern monophysit group inherit entir tradit nestorius ' version may suffici balanc posit regard orthodox . 
clh first monophysit inherit none nestorius 's version opposit end spectrum . 
second histor record suggest posit attribut nestorius extrem success oppon wrote convent histori claim . 
main nestorius oppos term theotoko mari argu i think correct human could call mother god . 
i mean athanasian creed talk son uncreat sure even arian would conced jesus exist long mari . 
anyway nestorius 's oppon claim say mari theotoko claim gave birth human natur jesus would requir two seper distinct natur . 
the argument fail though mari simpli gave birth jesus preexist either divin accept nestorian common defin natur intertwin la chalcedon . 
second i sure nestorian better altern orthodox view . 
after i find hard believ pre-incarn jesus 's human natur heaven likewis post-ascens . 
i think rather god came earth took natur upon . 
it seper natur capabl tempt gethseman sinc i believ divin natur could never tempt moment weak divin natur prevail . 
comment warm appreci . 
jason albert there may differ mean subject sin . 
the origin complaint someon n't see could call jesus fulli human n't sin . 
i complet agre jesus subject temptat . 
i simpli object idea succumb therebi fulli human . 
i believ sin order human . 
i apolog confus nestorian monophysit .

there scholar maintain nestorius nestorian . 
i confess first time i read correspond nestorius oppon i thought got better . 
howev scholar believ work eventu led chalcedon advanc nestorius least rash dogmat editor the christolog controversi refer reject approach . 
as regular usenet reader know narrow much impedi wrong . 
furthermor say thing i think problemat . 
he respond rather mild letter cyril flame worthi usenet . 
in say to attribut also logo name incarn characterist flesh conjoin ... 
brother either work mind truli err fashion greek mind diseas insan heresi arius apollinari other . 
those thus carri away idea associ bound make divin logo part fed milk particip degre growh stand need angel assist fear ... 
these thing taken fals put deiti becom occas condemn us perpetr falsehood it 's well good maintain proper distinct human divin . 
but whole concept incarn base exact idea divin logo fact degre part born grow die . 
of cours must understood 's certain indirect logo ' particip thing . 
but must sort identif divin human n't incarn . 
nestorius seem think black white term miss sort nuanc one need deal area . 
you say i find hard believ pre-incarn jesus 's human natur heaven i n't think 's requir orthodox doctrin . 
it 's divin logo etern .
