luke 1833 scourg him kill him third day he rise . 
luke 2446 he said thus written christ suffer rise dead third day john 1125 jesus said i resurrect life believ me shall live even die john 209 for yet understand scriptur he must rise dead . 
act 173 ... explain give evid christ suffer rise dead say this jesus i proclaim christ the wit of the apostl paul 1 corinthian 151-26 1 now i make known brethren gospel i preach also receiv also stand 2 also save hold fast word i preach unless believ vain .

jesus 's enemi would stolen his bodi would perpetr resurrectionth opposit desir . 
2 . 
jesus ' discipl could stolen his bodi pontius pilat establish guard stand watch tomb lest his bodi stolen .
