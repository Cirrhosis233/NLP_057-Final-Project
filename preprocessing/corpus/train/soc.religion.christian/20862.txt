darren but far get ? 
onc god 's revel stop darren reason begin possibl error appear . 
i agre must make distinct clear teach scriptur product reasoneven reason base scriptur . 
howev i think i would draw line distinct reason ' less academ ' would . 
darren for exampl let 's suppos modern bibl translat darren includ perfect render jesus word last supper darren jesus said exact this bodi darren we ll presum said total without error darren absolut true . 
what certain ? 
not much . 
darren at moment stop speak peopl start darren interpret possibl error appear . 
did mean darren liter ? 
we record darren elabor word . 
was think tran- con- darren substanti ? 
he n't say . 
darren almost point make lutheran statement lord 's supper . 
the lutheran approach say jesus said this bodi believ . 
other interpret reject simpli taught scriptur . 
recal jesus ' word stand alon subject . 
we also paul 's word 1 corinthian 1117-34in pass us receiv lord . 
in particular said for whenev eat bread drink cup proclaim lord 's death come by word believ bread eat lord 's supper realli bread well lord 's bodya sens fact tell us . 
doe prove tran-substanti fals ? 
i suppos someon could say paul spoke metaphor lord 's bodi bread simpli way bodi appear eat . 
but thought found nowher scriptur . 
so reject . 
thus primari reason reject tran-substanti prove fals simpli found scriptur . 
side remark i ve told lutheran doctrin real presenc con-substanti . 
but non-lutheran told . 
we tend use word . 
i almost think use professor compar religion need label compar cathol lutheran reform teach lord 's supper . 
but almost everi church want call teach real presenc tradit teach church . 
end side remark darren when christian speak believ reason darren never lead astray implicit claim darren infal non- christian around us rare believ darren implicit claim .
