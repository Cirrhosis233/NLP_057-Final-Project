hello i seen two common thread run post atheist newsgroup i think use explain . 
unfortun i n't direct quot handi ... 
1 atheist believ die die forev . 
more correct peopl die ceas exist . 
2 a god would condemn fail believ etern death unfair . 
i n't see problem ! 
to christian hell definit etern deathexact atheist expect die . 
the idea i ve gotten christian hell like heaven afterlif i.e n't ceas exist subject etern tortur well 's orthodox idea anyway etern death prefer . 
atheist n't believ sort afterlif . 
liter interpret bibl problem view sinc bibl talk fire hell . 
person i n't think peopl hell thrust flame i expect jesus double-edg sword issu mouthi treat state- ment metaphor . 
i think 's safe say hell never intend metaphor . 
certain equival ceas exist . 
some christian concept inde metaphor idea hell 20th centuri interpret . 
it cours nice see even christian might evolv fit worldview modern age i fear church accept . 
understand per- hap accept hell metaphor re one step closer turn god metaphor well .
