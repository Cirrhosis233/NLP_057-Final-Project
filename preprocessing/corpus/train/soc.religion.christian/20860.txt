you ask . 
i would echo question . 
i 'm tri contenti . 
but assum pope univers jurisdict author author reli upon decis ? 
what prevent choos ani doctrin i like say papal disagr error resolv time ? 
this especi true sinc council bishop basic stood pope . 
the ultim question tradit theolog church . 
this thing possibl resist pope departur tradit doctrin church . 
if command author conflict tradit command must disobey . 
my view conflict could happen major way . 
god would never allow hair-split situat develop would complex peopl figur . 
i n't view present situat church anyth extrem complic . 
run list happen last 30 year cathol church imparti observ aghast . 
it appear much lie heart matter disagr tradit tradit also author disciplin . 
the problem stem general widespread ignor cathol faith opinion . 
most cathol know zilch cathol faith leav wide open destruct er bishop . 
it 's basic reform part ii . 
there even question mind respect shard cathol church current trampl upon cathol hierarchi . 
i could go list shock thing hour probabl . 
take situat campo brazil exampl . 
i 'm read book happen vatican council ii . 
the bishop antonio de castro-may never introduc chang follow wake vatican ii . 
he kept tradit mass old catech etc . 
he made sure peopl knew faith cathol theolog obedi modern etc . 
he innocul peopl come . 
well one day order came rome retir . 
it came pope sick . 
bishop de castro-may wait pope recov inquir whether command pope realli want someth liber command absenc . 
the pope confirm decis . 
so good bishop retir . 
the injustic follow complet incred . 
a new bishop instal .

the new bishop would visit parish celebr new mass . 
the peopl would prompt walk church en mass . 
the bishop enrag . 
he usual resort enlist help secular author eject priest church . 
the priest would start build new church peopl complet behind . 
the old parish new mass bishop desir virtual parishion .

nor oblig say new mass . 
dure process peopl campo privat individu includ civil author constant send petit letter rome someth new modernist bishop . 
noth ever done help ever arriv rome . 
eventu 37 priest kick 40000 peopl . 
my question support sspx is ani way posit respect church reform could chang conform pope ? 
assum pope 's posit chang leader sspx n't joint make choic . 
if appear claim infal teach author . 
if i adopt view i 'm not wrong i ca n't wrong 's no way i ll chang mind you must chang i ve either left cathol church left . 
if pope defin certain thing ex cathedra would end controversi . 
that process well understood cathol theolog anyon n't go along instant non-cathol . 
the problem peopl appreci go cathol world . 
if knew faith bishop would shock ! 
we sould argu second come real tradit teach church . 
if simpl matter east west would separ 900 year . 
this n't case cathol church . 
there massiv bodi tradit teach . 
the pope last 150 year especi relev . 
there question tradit doctrin . 
i thought teach magisterieum church allow error teach regard faith moral even short term . 
i may wrong i 'm roman cathol . 
that 's heresi less . 
although done great job sinc reform last 30 year seen mani error spread 's piti . 
infal rest pope church whole . 
in short term pope larg section church go astray . 
in fact 's usual happen major heresi larg section church go astray . 
the pope histor much reliabl . 
everyth alway come back long run . 
what would effect pope make ex cathedra statement regard sspx situat ? 
would honor ? 
if get around formal doctrin infal ? 
again i 'm tri content i 'm tri understand . 
sinc i 'm orthodox i ve got real vest interest outcom one way . 
yes would honor . 
infal infal . 
but go defin ? 
that new mass better express cathol faith old ? 
that sex educ cathol school wonder ? 
that religion wonder except profess pope prior vatican ii ? 
it command legitim . 
sspx view pope 's command legitim .

this veri slipperi slope .
