these folk believ baptism done formula mention jesus rather father son holi spirit . 
this may doctrin implic far i know mean folk deni exist divin father . 
i 'm right one describ theolog fact i think may sever includ would classic call monophysit arian two rather differ view well belief probabl consist trinitarian standard wo n't use trinitarian languag misunderstand simpli biblic . 
clh not biblic ?

2818and jesus came said all author heaven earth given . 
19go therefor make discipl nation baptiz name father son holi spirit 20 teach obey everyth i command . 
and rememb i alway end age other ancient author add amen nrsv the note give sens emend . 
do text contradict regard baptism ? 
or misunderstand triniti like explan ? 
but mayb i simpli misunderstand view . 
is anyon els forc read group good bibl unabridg dictionari ? ? 
christian realli educ . 
arrgggghhhh . 
when i talk peopl reject trinitarian languag unbibl i speak trinitarian theolog thing like one essens three person . 
obvious three-fold baptism formula biblic point . 
i normal use term three-fold refer mat . 
while certain consist belief triniti triniti doctrin whose full formul occur 4th 5th cent 's . 
it 's unlik mat . 
mind fully-develop trinitarian doctrin . 
inde three-fold baptism formula use group believ triniti . 
the disagr baptism formula occur passag act 238 command baptism name jesus . 
there coupl passag act well . 
this leav us sort problem re command mat . 
baptiz name father son holi spirit act baptiz name jesus . 
jesus group baptiz name jesus . 
they consid consist mat 2818 say jesus name father son holi spirit . 
i 'm right one ask explain mean . 
i simpli say appear normal trinitarian theolog . 
it also odd way deal idiomat phrase name . 
those use three-fold formula n't seem standard answer passag talk baptiz name jesus . 
i suspect common explan say name need verbal formula . 
to say baptiz name jesus may simpli mean baptism jesus ' author . 
in 1st cent . 
context contrast christian baptism baptism john jewish baptism . 
of cours 's certain parallel passag . 
that suggest could well say mat 2818 n't requir specif three-fold formula use baptism simpli character baptism done follow father son holi spirit . 
one might well suspect earli church one baptism formula use . 
so long consid follow jesus follow father son holi spirit great damag would done differ . 
this mean i think go back use formula . 
baptism one thing almost christian group recogn mutual i think someth upset would interest gospel . 
this reinforc fact group actual use name jesus seem mind differ doctrin . 
but i ve said i 'm one explain doctrin .
