hi anybodi tri compil ctrltest mfcsampl directori compil mfc-lib bwc seem bwc n't abl distinguish pointer overload function . 
for exampl imagin follow 2 overload function void samenam void void samenam int after tri whole day i think bwc imposs take adress one two function assign proper defin function pointer . 
am i right has anybodi els problem thanx i think may chase wrong problem . 
i n't think function overload i sort thing time bc without hitch . 
the big problem i encount port mfc bc fact mfc depend coupl invalid c assumpt . 
i never gotten entir ctrltest app run bc reason ms make bad assumpt order staticglob object initi i.e . 
object get access initi . 
the problem owner-draw menu code somewher comment section piec ctrltest work fine . 
two major gotcha i found use mfc bc the cfileopenflag enum use hard-cod number open mode rather manifest constant defin fcntrl.h differ msc bc . 
all mfc collect class depend anoth bad c assumpt refer base object use place refer deriv object true pointer not refer . 
i sure problem along line i encount yet . 
i seen mfc 2.0 yet i hope address . 
if ms 's hype portabl vendor 's compil .
