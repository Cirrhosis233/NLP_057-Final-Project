if i put lastdriv z config.si netx run i ca n't access drive f log novel . 
if i n't put lastdriv z config.si i ca n't access w4wg drive file-manag . 
it seem way make netx work lastdriv statement config.si . 
first i n't use w4wg i think 's chang ! . 
the problem lastdriv command way netwar general case netx particular add drive devic chain . 
set lastdrivez mean unassign oppos unus drive letter netwar use tack drive map -onto end- exist list drive . 
w4wg obvious attach network drive exist unus drive letter . 
i 'd guess next thing i 'd tri someth like lastdrivem machin leav fair swath drive w4wg still allow 13 netwar drive map well . 
w4wg requir dos drive . 
i use lastdrivej make first novel drive k leav drive g h i j w4wg . 
my local dos drive use a-f .
