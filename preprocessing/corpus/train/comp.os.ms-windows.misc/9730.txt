repost summar inform addit comment . 
this is long i 16mb memori 386sx 25 mhz intel math coprocessor 120mb hard drive 20mb free compress . 
i run mathcad 3.1 window 3.1 enhanc mode 5mb ram drive 2mb1mb smart drive swap file perman temporari sever month . 
i interest faster mathcad 4.0 i concern report swap file requir legitimaci mathsoft 's claim increas speed . 
to 386sx user will mathcad 4.0 run without swap file insist i use swap file ? 
so far respons less detail descript setup unrel post inform answer net e-mail appear accord mathsoft . 
mathcad use swap file extens overburden physic resourc . 
they say actual win32 featur . 
a figur 10mb indic minimum . 
but might tri anyway ! 
i 'm certain mathcad culprit . 
i 48666dx2 16mb main memori less 2mb ramdisk bit dos session open part startup process i run without swapfil . 
when i instal win32 subsystem march beta nt sdk win32 subsystem demand presenc swapfil . 
the win32 program i ve run date 32-bit version freecel came subsystem . 
i gave window small temporari swapfil i 'm leeri file must remain fix locat hard disk seem well . 
what win32 ? 
i upgrad mathcad 4.0 instal directori win32 windowssystem dure upgrad told win32 requir . 
mathcad 4.0 make use win32 librari . 
you ve probabl heard win32 32-bit window librari provid much window nt function support thread multitask run window 3.1 . 
i also 16 mb ram inde mathcad 4.0 insist perman swapfil would run otherwis . 
3 mathcad absolut requir 4mb ram 12mb swap file 8mb ram 8mb swap file . 
it give enough memori error swap file less 8mb . 
it major resourc hog . 
if load symbol processor smart math take 5mb ram real virtual load due win32 librari . 
so seem addit system requir shown mathsoft 's advertis 4.0 need swap file possibl big 12mb . 
look like i would need 8mb swap file would need choos i ? 
faster perman swap file slower temporari swap file appar win32 subsystem ship mathcad 4.0 much disk space requir ? 
i also receiv answer if ve got 16 meg ram configur 10meg ram disk mathcad ? 
dos 6 permit differ bootup configur . 
can mathcad 4.0 win32 configur use ram drive instead swap file ? 
if i n't see use dos 6.0 altern bootup would provid window swap file . 
some time back i rememb discuss issu use ram drive support swap file i thought involv slower 8mb system . 
i dos 6.0 various reason yet done full instal . 
by way full instal dos 6.0 requir avail oneself altern bootup featur ? 
which file instal disk requir ? 
presum mean without perman swap file . 
if window need swap file upo creat one perman one n't exist . 
perman general faster though . 
i n't know mathcad would n't happi either typev . 
3.0 program conform win specif .
