dear friend the risc mean reduc instruct set comput . 
the risc usual small instruct set reduc circuit complex increas clock rate high perform . 
you read book comput architectur inform risc . 
hmm ... 
i author risc i clear rememb read instruct set risc cpus rather larg . 
the differ address mode risc instruct set orthogon cisc . 
i hope clear taken one lectur note ... 
the altern approach cisc adopt mani recent year come known risc reduc instruct set comput . 
this characteris simpli simpler faster simplifi design e.g . 
reduc varieti instruct address mode hardwar design run faster . 
even cost need instruct task done quick simpler faster design . 
a typic risc processor provid larg number regist e.g . 
32 perform data oper regist provid address mode e.g . 
immedi regist offset ' allow load store oper access memori use instruct format support data type e.g . 
integ unsign float .
