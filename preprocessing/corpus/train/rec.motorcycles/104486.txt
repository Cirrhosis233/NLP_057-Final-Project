1 . 
all us argu gyroscop etc . 
through understand techniqu counterst . 
includ one think counterst way corner ? ? 
the under physic differ matter need taught beginn . 
agre ! 
counterst techniqu taught understand techniqu one develop maxim effect emerg avoid manuv . 
this realli thing disagre . 
mayb agre disagre ? ? 
i still think tell newbi steer left turn right unnecessarili confus ll anyway get bike ride damn thing . 
2 . 
i know exact 's happen . 
it 's git n't clue ! 
me ! ! 
understand physic traction fine i see detail theori like place motorcyl train cours . 
all need know maximum traction obtain tyre begin slide road . 
then violent disagr . 
while state true insuffici form traction manag polici . 
avail traction increas appli normal forc ie traction avail front wheel increas weight shift brake forc correspond decreas rear . 
thus techniqu appli brake eas rear increas pressur front best learn understand weight shift avail traction . 
jeez ed start talk traction manag polici i thought make weird refer look railway locomot ... 
the offici line though i doubt front brake appli first follow rear brake idea avoid lock rear weight transfer take place . 
in practic i suspect peopl describ . 
say brake tire begin slide next useless advic newbi . 
he go slide tire find ! 
it also give zero inform develop brake techniqu chang brake correspond weight shift develop . 
if n't slide tyre way know whether ve achiev maximum brake . 
i 'm suggest alway aim brake hard possibl want find limit machin go beyond .
