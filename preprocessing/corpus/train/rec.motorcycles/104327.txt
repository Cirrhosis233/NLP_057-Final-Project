if talk 4-stroke i think i understand exhaust puls affect 2-stroke intak valv close exhaust stroke gas push cyclind . 
i guess gas compress may affect amount push limit factor seem header pipe canist . 
mean would gase far line canist realli effect exhaust stroke ? 
do gase realli compress much ? 
for discuss purpos i ignor dynam effect like puls exhaust pipe tri paint use mental pictur . 
1 . 
unless engin supercharg pressur avail forc air intak tract atmospher . 
at time intak valv open pressur differenti avail move air differ combust chamber pressur left exhaust stroke atmospher . 
as piston decend intak stroke combust chamber pressur decreas allow atmospher pressur move air intak tract . 
at time pressur ever becom negat even approach good vacuum . 
2 . 
at time exhaust valv close pressur combust chamber essenti pressur exhaust system first major flow restrict muffler . 
note volum gas must flow exhaust much larger volum must flow intak temperatur differ product combust . 
3 . 
in last 6-8 year japanes manufactur start pay attent exhaust intak tune pursuit almighti horsepow . 
at point time high-perform bike substitut aftermarket free-flow air filter almost zero affect perform stock intak system flow well anyway . 
substitut aftermarket exhaust system make littl differ unless general new exhaust system much louder stocker . 
4 . 
on older bike exhaust back-pressur domin factor . 
if free-flow air filter substitut littl differ note unless free-flow exhaust system instal well . 
5 . 
in general engin visual air pump . 
at given rpm anyth caus engin pump air intak exhaust side caus produc horsepow . 
pump air requir recalibr rejet carburetor .
