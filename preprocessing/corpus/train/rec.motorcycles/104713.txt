do honda gurus know i replac front sprocket 1979 honda cb750k slight larger one ? 
i see prefer reduc size rear one that 's twin-cam right ? 
there 's steel guard right next sprocket keep broken chain punch hole engin case 's need . 
there 's probabl enough room fit bigger sprocket . 
i 'd inclin take two teeth rear 5 ratio chang rather ad one front 7 . 
if rais overal gear ratio much ll impair bike 's rideabl gear far enough apart one gear provid adequ respons given speed . 
honda 750s n't widest power band .
