we seem agreement two explan one use handlebar lean move motorcycl . 
the question one effect domin one ? 
the idea would design experi would seaprat two characterist see effect produc similar result one us bike familiar . 
as point experi would difficult . 
but know enough physic situat calcul . 
there fact three effect contribut lean bike begin turn . 
1 . 
gyro effect caus torqu twist bike . 
2 . 
contact patch shift one side caus bike fall . 
3 . 
contact patch acceler side caus torqu twist bike . 
take averag bikerid averag bike wheel speed 5 15 50 mph say calcul much twist bar would need produc say 20 degre lean say 2 second effect alon . 
my guess slow speed 2 domin high speed 3 domin speed 1 contribut far bugger relat speak . 
by way similar problem runner want run round corner get lean corner fast ? 
is run group could start counter-foot argument fall tri work go round corner ?
