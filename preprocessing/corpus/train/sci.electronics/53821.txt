i built littl project use radio shack 5vdc relay switch audio . 
i got pretti bad click ' thing switch . 
i common thing one suppos use relay noth seem get rid click . 
my question is good relayrelay circuit i use switch audio no nois kind audio line . 
i appreci advic refer advic . 
also exact part numberscompani name etc . 
relay help ! 
are switch high level signal low level signal like pre-amp level signal ? 
also click mention big clack happen switch refer contact bounc ? 
how drive relay ? 
ttl gate output ? 
switch transistor ? 
how relay connect drive ? 
need specif answer question ! ! 
as general rule relay clean switch audio tri tranfer circuit contact . 
the nois hear due momentari open close path . 
the noiseless way transfer audio ground circuit . 
in high imped audio circuit resist t construct close characterist imped circuit . 
ground imput connect t transfer audio . 
in low imped circuit transform usual use input short ground . 
secondari parallel characterist imped . 
sometim necessari actual switch audio second contact use momentarili short circuit output durat switch time . 
telephon relay handi contact adjust make break vica versa i n't seen year . 
nowadi switch done electron op amp etc . 
a novel circuit i use build primit optic isol .. 
it consist resist photocel lamp packag tube . 
when lamp cell high resist . 
turn lamp resist lower pass audio . 
onc devic t switch audio . 
vari lamp resist give remot volum control . 
use 2 variabl resist mixer ! 
lot luck !
