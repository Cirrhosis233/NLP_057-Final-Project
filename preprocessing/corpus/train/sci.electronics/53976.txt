i 'm wonder 's possibl use radio wave measur distanc transmitt receiv ? 
yes could . 
seem abl measur signal strength determin distanc . 
this would short distanc 2000 ft i would need accuraci 6 inch . 
well letse whip hp-48sx soon gx 6 inches3108 ms.5 nanosecond resolut . 
hmm . 
that ll rather difficult ! 
the standard read better method use ultrasound general somewher around 40khz . 
sound travel heck lot slower light radio wave therefor much easier deal . 
what frequenc would best ? 
or matter ? 
it might easiest visit hardwar store look numer sonic estim type devic want . 
mani pretti cheap 30 . 
in fact awhil stanley estim sell someth like 8 . 
that 's one i bought !
