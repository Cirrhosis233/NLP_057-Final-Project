as far i 'm concern 's amp touch price rang . 
the build qualiti impress far superior amp price rang . 
the whole amplifi extrem solid massiv heat sink solid case . 
if open amp good qualiti compon amp seem design extrem well . 
perfect symmetri channel two transform one channel . 
the bind post back amplifi virtual class model 70 ie .
