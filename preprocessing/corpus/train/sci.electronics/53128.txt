i agre . 
i come nuclear physic one often discuss particle-hol excit certain reaction effect appli annihil oper creat hole subtl question . 
the longer one work real becom . 
there also quasi-particl rais sort question real entiti . 
the phenomenon certain real one . 
ok i ve ask new thread line i ask 1 if larg hole current run thru resistor i2 r cool instead heat ? 
2 can anyon design amplifi preferenti amplifi hole current normal electron current ? 
3 semiconductor materi highest ratio hole mobil electron mobil ? 
pleas quot actual test sampl rather estim base theori . 
also n't limit semiconductor consid also insul resistor dielectr piezo-electr conductor magnet metal ceram magnetostrict etc . 
note summar thread far state area hole detect vacuum . 
that hole particl exist presenc matter . 
previous thread state hole exist certain semi-conductor . 
the question natur aris hole current insid semi-conductor vanish point semiconductor join conductor say copper . 
i n't want theoret discuss whether hole could exist insid metal conductor rather i ask experiment discuss amplifi detect current exist . 
also note i cross-post sci.electron sinc becom electron discuss . 
thanx eric . 
et a forc natur
