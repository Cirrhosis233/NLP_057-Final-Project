c vincent c the standard at bus isa run 8mhz 12.5 mhz non-stnadard isa buse higher clock rate care sinc board n't work faster standard rate . 
for instanc 486 adjust at bus speed pas16 audio card choke i ad data acquisit bus speed faster 10mhz . 
the fact non-turbo-mod speed ad n't work weird .

33 mhz bus 486dx2 66 refer local bus . 
fyi at bus oper asynchron link local bus via bus interfac ' one function chipset ' .
