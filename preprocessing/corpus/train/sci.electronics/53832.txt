i tri build circuit detect presenc video vs . 
blank screen monitor rg b output graphic card . 
it abl detect presenc singl pixel 65 mhz would mean detect 15 ns puls . 
it also abl tell differ blank screen 300 mv dim screen say around 310 mv . 
oh yes also need cheap . 
my first circuit dismal failur . 
i use 3 compari compari input go one gun input went refer creat voltag dividera potentiomet . 
the first problem compari way slow .. 
i need get sever pixel row would fire compari i could whole screen full text circuit would detect . 
the second problem nois refer smallest differ blank screen dim screen . 
in fact differ complet black complet white 650 mv . 
i wonder i go amplifi video signal make work . 
there faster compari expens requir split suppli . 
i would need replac .49 quad compari three 1.89 compari creat whole new power suppli circuit . 
at point i think i need sort transistor circuit . 
transistor fast cheap trick ... 
unfortun i way leagu it come design transistor circuit i appeal net help . 
ani idea tip circuit pointer refer etc . 
would great appreci . 
oh yes i sampl output thing everi second i n't need fast respons time howev i n't found way take advantag fact . 
thank lot help anybodi might abl give . 
of cours undi gratitud .
