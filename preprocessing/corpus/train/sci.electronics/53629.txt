hi i look help choos packag high-spe silicon adc 100mhz current fabric . 
this phd research project i test chip speed pcb . 
i expect rough 100 packag circuit dc low-spe high-spe test use 3 differ set-up test chip . 
i know sure dip work long lead line high induct . 
get custom-mad packag expens i tri choos flatpak leadless chip carrier . 
the flatpack would hard test sinc solder test setup i would spend load time solder i kept chang test chip . 
the leadless chip carrier socket also long lead line may work high speed . 
doe anyon experienceknowledg field i would great appreci help ! 
ani idea name compani manufactur holderssocketspackag would help . 
p.s . 
the multi-lay fanci gaa packag seem like bit overkil ? 
seema varma you n't mention whether cost issu . 
where exact run 100mhz ? ? 
the digit side ? 
ttl ? 
ecl ? 
we run 200mhz 100mhz ic test equip day long ecl domain use dip 's along plcc 's 25mil 20mil pitch 256pin qfp 's name . 
i n't see problem packag long adher sound engin practic . 
a good sourc inform motorola 's mecl system design handbook . 
the latest ed . 
date 288 . 
that consid one bibl high-spe design . 
the fact need build test fixtur mean re like go need socket . 
it far induct per pin packag test mention imped discontinu . 
i n't see big concern packag probabl n't go make much differ if re tri get ttl run 100mhz fun ... 
ttl never design run 100mhz environ . 
aaron
