i ve use on-chip capacitor reduc ground-bounc nois small systol array chip 50pf load clock line . 
design 2-micron n-well cmos use mosi scalabl design rule . 
here thought bypass capacitor 1 they n't help much simultan output switchingther still larg induct bypass capacitor load capacitor signal line ground return still get ground power line bounc . 
2 they help lot on-chip load i high load clock line . 
3 the transient tri suppress realli high frequenc forget larg area poly-thin-oxide-diff capacitor sinc rc time constant larg . 
what i make metal2 metal poli diff sandwich put lot hole poli layer allow frequent diff-metal1 contact . 
i forget exact wide poli line . 
if i design i 'd probabl omit diff altogeth use solid poli sheet instead use m2 m1 poli substrat high resist ignor speed . 
4 you probabl better tri tune circuit run slight slower edg lower voltag swing especi output signal spend chip area capacitor . 
i spare space die sinc circuit big mosi tini chip next size twice big i need .
