i project droop lap somewhat pain design . 
what i look stabl ultra-long solid state timer . 
what want place thing antart ice shelf measur amount snow fall period six week . 
everi two week want trip selonoid discharg differ color pellet gas pressur across snow . 
then dig snow snow fall amount measur come differ color pellet . 
the problem tri build timer would stand cold -40 degre power sourc would n't drain . 
i look xr-2204 timer standard ne556 dual timer thier temp spec wo n't go low . 
also two week equat 1209600 second per fire mean one big time cap i found 2.2 farad yes farad cap work voltag 5 volt small size . 
but time discharg -40 lower degre n't linear . 
i think use sever timer chain togeth fire selonid end time period blast cold drain batteri six week pain . 
one possibl would use solar panel six month twilight . 
anyon good idea thank advanc ... 
-- wes -- suggest take motorola mc14536b set give puls everi sec ten sec either rc xtal clock input . 
feed mc14521b clock input decod output 1209600 sec output might add and ' gate decod chip get output reset puls back the'521 restart cycl ... 
trigger oneshot decod rise edg one shot goe mosfet drive mechan fire pellet launcher .. 
ckts requir uamp currentbetween 5 15 volt 12 volt gel cell amphour would last six week . 
then take ckt board batteri wrap 3 4 foam build box stuff ... plywood metal exterior ... 
build small heater 10-50 watt resistor seri keep batteri ckts warm . 
2nd thought use 2 batteri one heater one timer pellet trigger . 
insolate-insol ....... even though chip state al rate devic good -55 c .. 
the batteri consider reduct capac ... oh make sure area insid minium air leakag .. 
hope help rw long wind net ? ? gentl ...
