hello i bought new portabl cd player offic i notic proud proclaim 8 time oversampl box . 
now i think i understand oversampl rate discret sampl exceed highest frequenc compon interest factor i n't understand 8 time busi ... 
it seem i bought first cd player realli 10 year ago ? ! 
spec said 4 time ... 
could someon pleas tell whether i 'm get senil ? 
if i 'm good player take sampl higher rate ? 
if i realli want better fidel would n't i higher rate sampl record process ? 
furthermor i wrong interpret sampl rate player 's point view thing data rate bit stream come optic medium ? 
doe mean data rate relat rotat speed disk chang sinc 1983 ? 
note i tri figur stuff month ago various peopl net i could wrong . 
the data ever read bar mistrack cours eventu get turn 44.1 khz 16 bit two channel data . 
oversampl take two discret data point interpol n-1 point n time oversampl . 
when i ask peopl said interpol simpli linear interpol signific complic . 
anyway purpos oversampl move effect sampl rate n time 44.1 khz order use higher frequenc antialias filter . 
for qualiti filter higher oversampl let build cheaper filter wherea price filter higher oversampl let build better filter . 
so assum qualiti compon cd player remain oversampl allow manufactur produc slight better sound due anti-alia filter .
