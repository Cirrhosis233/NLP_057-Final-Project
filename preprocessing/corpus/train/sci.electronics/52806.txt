i look coupl compon catalogu i came across rang peltier effect heat pump intend cool compon . 
for heard effect put current one devic pump heat one side . 
revers current revers effect . 
i think temperatur differ give emf well . 
anyway struck could make nice coolhot box picnic one power regul thermostat coupl heat sink . 
the biggest devic shift 60w effici 80-90 ai n't bad although would flatten car batteri half hour . 
unfortun catalogu n't list anyth basic spec heat pump . 
i imagin would get back-emf temperatur gradient across devic increas . 
if presum power decreas back-emf increas eventu steadi state current consum assum leakag . 
if final temperatur differ two side could set suppli voltag noth although would lousi way control . 
what i would like know 1 are guess correct ? 
2 what open-circuit thermal resist typic devic ? 
i want sure coolbox go get warm fast i unplug 3 how peltier effect heat pump actual work ? 
it look like magic ! 
4 whi n't use thing domest fridgesfreez ? 
thank advanc paul .
