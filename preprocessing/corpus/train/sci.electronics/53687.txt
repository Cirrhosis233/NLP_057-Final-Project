i wonder massiv concret cylind ever present nuclear poer site . 
they look like cylind pinch middl . 
doe anybodi know actual purpos thing ? . 
i hear re call cool tower ' heck cool ? 
i hope someon help the actual hourglass hollow design generat draft exploit venturi effect . 
around base hourglass ring water tower . 
warm river water come steam condens plant spray louvr . 
the draft pull tower cool water evapor convect . 
the sensibl heat extract cool water drive forc draft generat . 
it note hourglass-shap cool tower use fossil nuclear plant . 
it also note locat water plenti cool tower use part time discharg temperatur would exceed releas limit . 
it thought warm discharg water damag fish . 
fishermen know thorough incorrect . 
nontheless stringent usual state regul remain instanc . 
sinc typic take 60000 hp worth pump move volum water need cool 1000 mwe plant cost use tower insignific .
