just thought mine sinc on-hook line aprox 48-50v off-hook usual drop 1 how led seri zener say around 30v . 
on-hook led off-hook led . 
would work ? 
if anyon triestri pleas let know . 
aye 's rub draw enough current light led equip phone compani think ve gone hook . 
in on-hook state re suppos draw current . 
which mean use digit voltmet . 
you use old vom phone compani equip detect might think 's someth wrong cabl . 
look guy 's problem ? 
if want light goe phone off hook need run seri line i mention previous post . 
if want light goe phone hook need voltag threshold detector . 
if re go seri diod thing easiest make sure led take current i ca n't recal off-hand 's someth like 100ma ? 
tip phone 's suppos ring ! 
even simpl zener led setup might end carbon real quick . 
whatev scheme use make sure ve got least 200v-rat compon frontend . 
also rememb i 'm mistaken phone line 600ohm equival circuit . 
ani current draw 48v get drop across 600ohm . 
that 's fine re rough 12v ma bell consid off-hook . 
but drop far probabl big no-no . 
the easiest implement accomplish ? ? 
tip -- - rectifi resistor diod v zener resistor v led ring this suggest ... go ahead blow hole get idea . 
choos high-effici led n't need much current get light . 
choos valu compon requir .
