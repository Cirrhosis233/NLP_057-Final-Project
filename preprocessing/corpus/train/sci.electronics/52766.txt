i look info i get nec 3d monitor . 
i know multisync . 
i plan buy one second-hand depend spec . 
doe anyon know minmax frequenc whether interlac non-interlac video compat etc ? 
i seen refer .28 pitch 1024 x 720 resolut support svga one sourc n't support svga anoth sourc . 
neither sourc seem much reliabl info i n't want take guess . 
i 'm home right away monitor file follow top head subject revis worth-what-ya-pay-for-it sort info . 
if n't hear anyon spec sheet hand e-mail i ll look . 
if i 'm rememb correct 3d 14 0.28 mm pitch multisync cover least vga 31.5 khz horizont 60 hz vertic 1024 x 768 60 hz go 48 khz horizont . 
it may go somewhat higher horizont wo n't happi anyth beyond 1024 x 768 14 0.28 tube probabl wo n't thrill 1024 x 768 tube sync display . 
i prefer least 16 0.28 resolut . 
sinc svga 800x600 ll . 
the horizont rang probabl goe lower 31.5 i n't know goe way straight ntsc-rate tv need 15.75 khz sweep . 
as far video compat i 'm read question right wo n't take anyth analog rgb input . 
in word way decod ntsc yc video input . 
you would need sort board convers like sort thing let display ntsc vga display .
