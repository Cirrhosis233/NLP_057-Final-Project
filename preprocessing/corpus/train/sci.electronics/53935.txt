i troubl obtain specifi standbi current drain mc146818a real time clock ... 
lowest current drain i acheiv 3.7v vcc 150ua . 
this three time specifi maximum ... 
1 made sure reset assert trlh powerup as low time . 
2 made sure cycl as negat rd wr stbi assert ... 
are input chip come ttl ? 
standby-drain spec cmos chip typic appli input pull way zero way vcc . 
ttl n't good former wo n't latter without help pullup resistor . 
this sort thing easili multipli power consumpt consider factor cmos transistor suppos off n't way hard off .
