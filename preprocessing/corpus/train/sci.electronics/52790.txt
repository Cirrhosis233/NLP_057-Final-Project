can someon explain exact trigger ' featur found oscilloscop ? 
lot og good explan delet lot delet is anybodi els not like digit scope . 
my school beauut 100mhz hp digit bell whistl includ soft-key i think loveley touch . 
softwar key . 
you n't forget deal comput . 
those scope even neat still make ickyest look wave . 
lotsa featur ugli output . 
and best digit i ever seen . 
i ve seen lot cheaper digit look terribl . 
i think hangup digit scope know much work scope-by-scop basi function typic present opinion counter-intuit fashion hp made stride 54600 seri imo . 
automat setup fine simpl repetit waveform give crazi result complex event need understand scope actual measuringprocess event . 
for exampl scope equival time real time sampl mode equival time mode sampl built-up slowli ad delay trigger event sweep ? 
what scope 's actual sampl rate time ? 
how data massag captur display etc . 
one common misconcept speed scope . 
is hp scope re use realli 100 mhz scope ? 
or 20 mhz sampl rate scope 5 mhz singl shot signific whose front end includ sh support 100 mhz waveform import equival time sampl ? 
the 100 mhz input case realli help waveform repetit singl sampl get lucki hit transient event sampl time . 
so lot variabl understand get use inform digit scope . 
i prefer analog scope general use digit event i need storag later analysi comparison event within capabl scope . 
now price true 100 mhz digit scope fall ...
