i new scope i thought i 'd save buck buy one function generat built . 
after awhil i notic two thing function generat . 
for one seem bias even pull-offset ' push . 
that i pull know adjust get signal san random 50mv bias . 
the realli annoy thing damn output wo n't go 1v p-p . 
i student may guess previous post i often measur input imped various circuit i build.mani circuit maximum input signal way less 500mv amplitud input imped 10 's kohm rang . 
the thing order use function generat i divid voltag thing reason . 
then cours measureth input imped circuit i go throw anoth resistor seri . 
with 50ohm output generat i could ignor littl divid i figur . 
it 's kind pain ass . 
is way i could make littl box could solv littl problem . 
the box would tkae function generat input lower voltag give output imped low unchang number . 
i would want lower voltag factor one hundr . 
i could build littl buffer amp i 'd like box activ . 
ani quick idea . 
the scope 's broken . 
for reason i sent shop get repair replac . 
the function generat way one . 
pleas help i feel stupid today
