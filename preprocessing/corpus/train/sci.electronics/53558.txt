i would like digit output squid magnetomet rang -10 v 10 v digit signal process comput say macintosh ii 486 pc . 
i would like good 16 bit adc good linear high convers speed least 50 khz prefer 200 khz . 
other concern 2 must i use adc extern comput avoid digit nois feedback sensit squid electron ? 
might good idea ... 
the resolut request 0.3mv in order get ve paid nois level better lower . 
it kind hard noisi box like expect insid pc . 
befor pay pc card test sampl low distort sine wave i think sine wave cd . 
digit domain there possibl low thd sourc run digit waveform fft transform take alook nois floor spectrum . 
that 's give good indic design . 
that 's i test data acquist system i design i got idea maxim data sheet . 
if live 14 bit resolut i would recommend look max121 maxim . 
it high speed 308khz complet sampl ad dsp interfac . 
the input rang 5v use serial interfac easili optic isol comput elinim major nois sourc the analog design guid i got show -100db nois level . 
they claim -77db a evalu kit avail . 
might want give nice folk call .

this assum build das write softwar . 
hey get max121 free sampl call 1-800 i would appreci discuss person experi mac pc- base adc system . 
i would recommend find resolut gotten system look nois level otherwis might throw money .
