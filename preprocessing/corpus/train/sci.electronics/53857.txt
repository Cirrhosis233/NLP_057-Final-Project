one thing friend mine mention someth near-uv light cheaper get actual uv light . 
doe anyon know refer ? 
i n't want get semant argument contrari post near uv light actual uv light the near mean close visibl spectrum i.e . 
relat long wavelength near uv i 'm sure figur far uv . 
regular incandensc flashlight bulb emit tini amount uv near end spectrum filter use remov visibl light thus creat weak uv sourc . 
stronger sourc go requir gas probabl mercuri vapor discharg tube fluoresc tube uv phosphor . 
be care though strong uv sourc caus physiolog damag especi eye . 
the shorter wavelength danger . 
it would n't project beam like flashlight replac tube portabl fluoresc lantern uv tube would relat cheap way creat portabl sourc . 
it would bright enough use danger .
