decibel ratio . 
the question remain ratio refer unit use . 
sometim refer power 1 milliwatt given certain circuit imped also includ fine print known like 50 ohm rf circuit imped lead accept notat dbm . 
mayb might dbv disregard imped circuit power develop use 1 volt refer amplitud rather refer power . 
or might arbitrari omit refer includ notat lead plain db . 
so . 
look way'db ' impli refer notat dbm ' explicit refer . 
for power db 10log pmeasuredprefer for amplitud db 20log ameasuredarefer ' b ' bel standard term log ratio base 10 name alexand graham bell .

common refer audio 0 dbm 1 milliwatt across 600 ohm 0 dbv 1 volt 0 vu zero vu meter 4 dbm pro gear line level 0 vu -10dbv consum gear line level often time power amp vu meter align use rate power amp 0 db point . 
it done whatev refer reason applic moment . 
note circuit given mayb unknown linear imped amplitud goe mani decibel power also increas amount . 
this proof done two ident ohm 's law .
