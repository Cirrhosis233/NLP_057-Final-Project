i project droop lap somewhat pain design . 
what i look stabl ultra-long solid state timer . 
what want place thing antart ice shelf measur amount snow fall period six week . 
everi two week want trip selonoid discharg differ color pellet gas pressur across snow . 
then dig snow snow fall amount measur come differ color pellet . 
the problem tri build timer would stand cold -40 degre power sourc would n't drain . 
i look xr-2204 timer standard ne556 dual timer thier temp spec wo n't go low . 
also two week equat 1209600 second per fire mean one big time cap i found 2.2 farad yes farad cap work voltag 5 volt small size . 
whi fool around analog job ? 
a singl chip micro crystal job reliabl easili . 
an 8748 cost 5 . 
that 1 crystal re busi . 
emb whole thing foam insul blanket power solar cell use excess power heat assembl day reli insul hold heat dark . 
if n't want tri thermal manag contact someon like icl cut special low temperatur crystal . 
it ll cost 20 . 
if use singl chip micro re look part count mayb 7 . 
a processor crystal two cap crystal power fet fire solenoid flyback diod batteri . 
this fewer part build analog timer infinit reliabl . 
add power zener diod heat solar cell part count scream 9 . 
pd assembl avail common singl chip micro . 
this applic trivial could even look op code programm 's guid creat binari hex editor .
