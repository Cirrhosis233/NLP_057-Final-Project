one thing ... 
bubblejet bubblejet . 
there bubblejet produc rather mediocr output hp 's dinki littl bubblejet wherea produc realli good look output hp 's deskjet . 
ibm canon produc realli good style bubblejet . 
p.s . 
if re market portabl bubblejet printer i high recommend hp portabl deskjet although i ve heard portabl canon good i need pcl support . 
with deskjet portabl even get undocu pcmcia card slot ! 
i second suggest . 
although i n't hp portabl deskjet i hp deskjet 500 . 
it give nicest output minor loss qualiti . 
for intens purpos paper letter resum i treat deskjet like laser printer you look bit close see blur charact . 
onli one grudg ink hp give smudg rather quick presenc moistur even though ink waterproof . 
howev would spend 500 laser qualiti . 
the cannon bubblejet nice howev n't seem much support eg driver popular program hp ink-jet . 
also hp deskjet regularplus500500c accept xerox paper i believ cut-sheet feeder option cannon bubblejet . 
if n't mind refil printer cheap ink say fountain-pen ink hp deskjet cheap maintain i paid 3.50 last bottl ink i expect last 9 month . 
-kimbal n't work hp love printer much !
