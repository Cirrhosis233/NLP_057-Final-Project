my friend nice alpin car stereo 2 channel one work . 
it put current voltag channel therefor blown ? 
i shut radio ran continu two speaker ouput channel charg discharg i know wire aint bad .... 
this probabl tell dc block capacitor 's seri one-chip single-end audio amp speaker termin . 
idea ? 
open look power amp ic . 
they ll fair obvious . 
replac one connect dead output . 
also would i locat signal radiotap unit befor get amplifi could n't i hook rca output signal could use littl amplifi ? 
well one thing poke around termin power amp chip . 
use probe 10m resistor like scope probe connect input small audio amp wspeaker . 
if find line-level input chip one chip bad probabl replac pretti easili . 
if want pick near-line-level signal suitabl feed outboard amp outer leg volum control pot often good enough . 
this volum control usual tone balanc control . 
if take center ground leg volum pot volum control probabl control . 
if unit modern type electron volum control chip probabl forget whole thing .
