so .. 
here 's question . 
it seem i 'd electr circuit i hook jumper neutral ground screw new three prong ' ground outlet . 
what 's wrong reason ? 
what can want three-prong outlet without addit wire use gfci outlet breaker outlet cheaper . 
in fact depend put new outlet gfci may requir . 
you still need suppli proper ground ground fault circuit interrupt ! 
so rewir still part job howev ground may connect local earth ground rather back breaker box . 
as jami said gfci devic requir code number place notabl bathroom outsid hous . 
i suggest use gfci outlet rather breaker . 
you end much less headach . 
nois pickup long cabl run sometim enough caus frequent trip breaker . 
gfci devic save live decid instal sure check regular use test button . 
run famili busi electr suppli light mani year i seen mani season electrician fri forgot doubl check common sens list . 
pleas exercis caution .
