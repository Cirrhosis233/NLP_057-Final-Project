i interfac simpl circuit run 9v cpu board run 5-6v . 
the optoisol 4n35 . 
on led side i put signal i want 10k resistor base 2n2222 . 
on transistor side i tie cpu input line collector pull-up resistor 47k . 
it function ok seem veri slow . 
i detect puls occur 2khz much faster . 
is n't risefal time devic someth like 5us ? 
i abl detect target 40khz i ca n't get 16khz . 
this done use wire-wrap wire go cpu test pin 8 inch long i 'm anyth high-spe . 
in art electron mention tie base phototransistor ground resistor improv speed . 
is i need ? 
how i calcul resistor valu ?
