hi i look help choos packag high-spe silicon adc 100mhz current fabric . 
this phd research project i test chip speed pcb . 
i expect rough 100 packag circuit dc low-spe high-spe test use 3 differ set-up test chip . 
i know sure dip work long lead line high induct . 
get custom-mad packag expens i tri choos flatpak leadless chip carrier . 
the flatpack would hard test sinc solder test setup i would spend load time solder i kept chang test chip . 
the leadless chip carrier socket also long lead line may work high speed . 
doe anyon experienceknowledg field i would great appreci help ! 
ani idea name compani manufactur holderssocketspackag would help . 
p.s . 
the multi-lay fanci gaa packag seem like bit overkil ?
