excerpt netnews.sci.electron 16-apr-93 re what nuclear subject re what nuclear site 's cool tower ? 
date fri 16 apr 93 212721 pdt i realli n't know post question i figur board would appropri . 
i wonder massiv concret cylind ever present nuclear poer site . 
they look like cylind pinch middl . 
doe anybodi know actual purpos thing ? . 
i hear re call cool tower ' heck cool ? 
except size cool tower nuclear power plant vertual ident construct oper cool tower design built 1890 's hundr year ago coal fire power plant use light earli electr railway . 
basic cylindr tower support rapid air draft air heat hot water andor steam circul thru network pipe fill lower 13 tower . 
to assist cool draft water mister ad spray cold water hot pipe . 
the cold water evapor remov heat faster air flow draft would result water vapor rapid carri away draft . 
this produc cloud frequent seen rise tower . 
that slight pinch mayb 23 way tower produc signific increas strength rate air draft produc compar straight cylind shape . 
the tower use recondens steam seal steam system power plant recircul back boiler use . 
the wider temperatur differ across turbin use power plant effeci recondens steam cool tower send back boiler maintain wide temperatur differ sometim high 1000 degre first stage hot turbin final stage cold turbin .

tim coslet technolog n . 
domest natur phenomena great explain howev left one detail alway see nuclear plant alway fossil fuel plant . 
at nuclear plant prefer run water close cycl wherea fossil fuel plant case get away dump hot water . 
as i recal water n't hot thermodynam mani fossil fuel plant cours less danger radioact contamin .
