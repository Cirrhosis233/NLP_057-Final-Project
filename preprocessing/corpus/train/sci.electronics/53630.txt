... stuff delet ... 
i also sceptic amp built far-east where-ev . 
but look amp see compon use design easili see amplifi sound brilliant . 
good point ... also i would n't surpris compon use off-shor inferior qualiti . 
as long proper design robust premium compon use n't matter assembl . 
i see peopl say amplifi wo n't last qualiti compon insid . 
sure amp run fair hot 's get amp sound incred good . 
an amp run hot bear 's gon na sound . 
the amp probabl run class-a whole day . 
actual i 'd wari excess hot amp cauz even though compon insid may rate run way excess heat dramat shorten life electron compon regardless qualiti . 
in fact amp run hot touch either engin manufactur amp want skimp heatsink cool save cost ! 
hmmmmm ....
