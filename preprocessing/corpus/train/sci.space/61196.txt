what evid indic gamma ray burster far away ? 
given enorm power wonder quantum black hole someth like fair close ? 
whi would galact rang ? 
pet theori 's fli saucer enter hyperspac reason ask everyon assum collid nuetron star spin black hole wonder mechan could exist place closer . 
pat well let see .... i took class last fall i note i ll tri wing ... 
here 's i understand . 
rememb stellar evolut black hole neutron starspulsar form high mass star mstar1.4msun . 
high mass star live fast burn hard take appoxim 105-107 year go nova supernova . 
in time n't live long enough get perturb galact plane assum sourc grb 's plane galaxi . 
then take catalog burst reciev various satellit around solar system pioneer venus one either pion . 
10 11 ginga cours bats distribut test catalog . 
these test show burst isotrop distributioneven spread radial direct show sign homogen i.e . 
clump one direct . 
so unless sampl area insid disk galaxi sampl univers . 
not cool want figur hell caus thing . 
now i suppos say well stil may sampl insid disk well necessarili . 
rememb less interplanetari network burst detector baselin goe waaaay beyond plutopion 11 abl detector de tect sort differ angl satellit satellit . 
here 's analog you see plane overhead . 
you measur angl plane origin arbitrari coordin system . 
one friend mile away see plane measur angl zero point arbitrari system . 
the two angl differ abl triangul posit burst mayb find sourc . 
to knowledg one abl . 
i throw halo corona model n't work also . 
as i said look possibl astrophys burst short timescal high energi black hole pulsar exhibit much type behavior . 
if case i said star seem bound disk galaxi especi energet sourc . 
when look simul model burst confin disk sampl larg distanc say 750 mpc definit see anisotropi toward direct clump sourc direct galact center . 
as i said none characterist .
