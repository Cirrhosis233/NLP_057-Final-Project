the centaur control technolog .. 
state dept allow use outsid us . 
sorri . 
has anyon look possibl protoncentaur combo ? 
what would benefit problem combo obvious instabl xssr ? 
i n't seen specul . 
but salyut kb design bureau plan new lhlox second stage proton would boost payload leo 21000 31500 kg . 
geostationari goe 2600 kg . 
gal launcher version 6000 kg .. 
this scheme compet energia-m last year i n't heard except i recent read central special kb work successor soyuz booster must energia-m . 
so earli result energia-m guess noth clear russia . 
i 'm sure salyut kb get fund someon continu develop . 
the centaur alta 3 meter dia . 
proton 4 's good fit exist upper stage block-d set insid shround 4 meter dia . 
i n't know launch load etc .. 
sinc centaur surviv titan launch probabl wors proton titan srb 's probabl shake thing pretti good seem feasibl . 
except centaur fragil thing may requir integr pad avail . 
proton assembl transport horizonti . 
doe anyon know much stress way payload centaur could support bolt proton horizont taken rail road track erect pad ? 
they would also need lox lh facil ad proton pad unless new proton second stage actual built cours centaur support system facil doubt import us great cost . 
these system may viloat us law polit problem solv addit instabl cis mention .
