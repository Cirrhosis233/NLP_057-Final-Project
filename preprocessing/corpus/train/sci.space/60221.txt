paul quit frank i ll believ realli go work typic trash one need process i see put coupl ton one end get relat clean materi end plus abl run residu power . 
sound almost like perpetu motion n't ? 
i believ process come even close approach technolog econom feasibl given mix natur trash run oppos cost separ thing first differ run ' actinid i see dump ton one end pull relat clean materi . 
onc cost technolog risk etc . 
taken account i still class one idea throw wast sun . 
sure 's possibl physic well understood realli reason approach ? 
how ever go off- shelf technolog someon n't ? 
mayb part ssf design goal . 
gee fred . 
after bitter defens 20 khz power basic technolog ssf id think would support minor research program like . 
and anyon know particl physic know ipn could prove technolog ? 
the real reason acceler breeder inciner built n't reason . 
natur uranium still cheap geolog dispos actinid look technic reason .
