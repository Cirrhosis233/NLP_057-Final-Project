galileo 's hga stuck . 
the hga left close galileo venus flybi . 
if hga point att sun near venus would cook foci element . 
question whi could n't galileo 's cours manuev design hga ever sun point . ? 
the hga n't reflect wavelength might cook focal element figur good scalesth problem antenna could expos venus-level sunlight lest like icarus ' wing melt . 
i think glue well electron worri . 
thus remain furl axi alway point near sun small sunshad tip antenna mast would shadow fold hga . 
a larger sunshad beneath antenna shield spacecraft bus .
