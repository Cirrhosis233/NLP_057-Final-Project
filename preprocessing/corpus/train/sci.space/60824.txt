background the orion spacedr theoret concept . 
it would drive use thermonuclear explos drive spacecraft . 
the idea 'd deton devic somewher one ten megaton yield behind pusher plate attach main spacecraft . 
the shock wave explos would transfer momentum ship . 
now atmospher i see . 
the energi explos heat atmospher expand explos slam shock wave pusher plate . 
but vacuum two thing i see go hit plate fissionfus product barium krypton helium neutron evapor bomb case electromagnet radiat gamma most lightheat irradi fission product . 
would work ? 
i ca n't see em radiat impel much momentum especi given mass pusher plate seem re go get momentum transfer throw bomb back ship get deton re . 
i must miss someth . 
would someon enlighten via email ? 
thank . 
jim
