suppos soviet manag get moon rocket work made first . 
they could beaten us either their rocket n't blown pad thus set back andor a saturn v went boom . 
the apollo fire harsh a saturn v explos would hurt the soviet win would crush . 
that could technolog turn point us turn us today 's we anyth re super power much reserv attitud like soviet program today . 
kennedi gone 6869 war still east i think program would stall bad goal moon 70 would dead nasa tri figur went wrong . 
if beaten us i specul us would gone head done land also would determin set base earth orbit moon . 
whether would mar would depend upon whether soviet tri go . 
set lunar base would stretch budget nation i think militari valu lunar base would outweigh valu go mar least short run . 
thus would concentr moon . 
i speulat the saturn program would push 70s cost run would evil . 
nixon still win . 
the shuttl never propos skylab never built . 
by 73 program stall yet fuel crisi . 
a string small launch mark mid seventi . 
by 76 goal us man moon dead us space program drift till present day .
