comet shoemaker-levi 1993e may remain orbit around jupit long enough allow galileo make closeup observ . 
the orbit trajectori comet shoemaker-levi still determin . 
what posit uncertainti s-l 1993e ? 
i assum know galileo within meter . 
but without hga n't pretti good idea look imag ? 
if hga work could slew around near real time less speed light delay .
