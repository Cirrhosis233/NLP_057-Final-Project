read amoco perform product data sheet erl-1906 resin t40 carbon fiber reinforc compress strength 280000 psi . 
it densiti 0.058 lbcu therefor theoret height constant section column support 4.8 million inch 400000 ft 75 statut mile . 
now real structur horizont brace either truss type guy wire use crush strength . 
let us assum oper 40 theoret strength . 
this give work height 30 mile constant section column . 
a constant section column limit high build someth allow taper cross section go . 
for exampl let us say 280000 pound load support top tower simplic calcul . 
this requir 2.5 squar inch column cross section area support weight . 
the mile structur payload weigh 9200 lb 1 mile payload total load 289200 lb 3.3 increas . 
the next mile structur must 3.3 thicker cross section support top mile tower plus payload . 
each mile structur must increas area ratio way bottom . 
we see theoret limit area although practic limit base much composit afford 40lb much load need support ground need foundat bedrock support . 
let us arbitrarili choos 1 billion limit costruct cost . 
with afford perhap 10000000 lb composit assum finish structur cost 100lb . 
the 40lb figur materi cost . 
then towerpayload mass ratio 35.71 . 
at 3.3 mass ratio per mile tower height becom 111 mile . 
this clear signific atmospher . 
a rocket launch top tower still provid orbit veloc atmospher drag g-loss almost elimin . 
g-loss compon rocket thrust vertic direct counter graviti contribut horizont orbit veloc . 
thus repres wast thrust . 
togeth drag rocket start ground 15 veloc penalti contend . 
this analysi simplifi consid wind load . 
these requir structur support first 15 mile height . 
abov air pressur drop low enough valu big factor .
