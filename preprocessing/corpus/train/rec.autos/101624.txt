i ca n't imagin civic saturn owner flex'n ego stop light race . 
it generat much excit two nerd challeng game one-on-on basketbal ! ! 
the sl2 0-60 8.5 note closer 968 paseo storm pseudo-sporti car . 
that 's ridicul comparison i know point saturn high-end civic matter acceler fine fact better unimprov muscl car 60s 300 hp great tie 2 ton n't go quick . 
saturn hand use 125 hp tie 2400 lbs short gear move quick line . 
anyway .... 
while 0-60 time consist car magazin report i saw pbs motorweek show clock 5-speed sl2 7.9 second . 
i 'm sure sl2 owner veri lucki get speed 7.9 second still astonish fast small 4-door . 
a new civic ex run 8.2 second 0-60 i 'm mistaken . 
most car class lucki 9-second rang .
