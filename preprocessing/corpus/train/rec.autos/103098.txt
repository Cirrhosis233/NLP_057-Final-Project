wagon i heard somehow slight faster coup . 
wagon automat 's slower . 
could due rear-end ratio also . 
usual automat differ rear-end manual limit experi anyway . 
you ll fun look rear-end gear shoth taurus front-wheel-dr vehicl ... 
i went back check articl the sho wagon quicker sho automat signific slower real sho . 
whi anyon would order sho automat transmiss beyond ca n't handl stick stick regular taurus leav sho real driver . 
that say n't real driver ca n't use stick eg disabl person n't posit use sho anyway . 
i would will bet remov automat transmiss performance-typ car like 5.0l mustang camaro like 'd cut number accid year . 
auto fine sedat littl sedan busi perform car imho .
