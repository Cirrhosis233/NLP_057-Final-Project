i 'd like add beretta gtz car kick gs-r butt anyday 's lot cheaper boot compar gtz gsr appl orang somewhat like mustang 5.0 crx differ way thing ought appeal differ buyer i.e . 
i n't think acura owner would seen dead chevi dealership vice versa . 
stuff delet -weather xgtv4 mention integra ride alot better no integra i seen come all-season tire . 
the gtz come much bigger 16 wheel . 
along integra car small 14 inch tire your acceleart time also vari magazin magazin road track car driver gs-r 6.8 8.0 road track . 
the cd figur almost certain bogus base hot prototyp suppli acura . 
the mt figur plausibl . 
also quarter mile time vari 15.4 16.1 16.1 sound reason probabl faster regular integra . 
so beretta handl integra certain keep acceler . 
and beretta probabl higher top speed due horsepow advantag 160117 hptorqu integra vs . 
180160 beretta . 
you alway believ exact number n't drive gs-r see self gs-r low 117 torqy high gear 8000 the gsr gear horribl day day drive . 
it need 6 speed box modern car . 
essenti 5th regualr integra equal 4th gsr regular integra buzzi speed . 
rpm make differ still would n't call torqu moster though ! 
consid save almost 3000 dollar beretta quad4 reliabl engin n't make sens get integra the person i knew gtz bought back gm lemon . 
it piecv junk quick fwd . 
quad 4 reliabl yeah 's definit reliable- 's reliabl safe say integra engin general near perfect the gsr owner i know engin throw rod less 5k mile rare screw honda . 
both gtz gsr flaw car . 
the perform enthusiast would take gtz cr purchas would gsr .
