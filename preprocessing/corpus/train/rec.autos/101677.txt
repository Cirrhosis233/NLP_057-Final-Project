ok argu . 
sl2 much lower base price sc2 ? ? ? 
's 1k cheaperi forget exact amount . 
n't cost extra doorswindowslocksmotor etc . 
4 door ? ? ? ? 
perhap market deal .... peopl want 2door pay extra 1.2k ? ? ? 
ok 's i understand the slsl1sl2sw1sw2 meant compet follow car honda civic toyota tercel slsl1 toyota corolla sl1sl2 nissan sentra mazda 323protog ' subaru loyaleimpreza isuzu stylus geo prizm ford escort mercuri tracer mistubishi mirag plymouthdodg colt their core competit civic corolla sentra . 
most model class n't first car would think . 
i threw escorttrac good amount japanes technolog similar reliabl stat . 
i n't includ domest small car cavali sunbird shadow sundanc tempo topaz sinc i think saturn go car least degre japanes root . 
the sc1sc2 meant compet follow car toyota paseo honda civic siciv coupesdel sol si nissan nx1600nx2000 mazda mx-3 isuzu impuls geo storm ford escort gt if look price car re expens re 4-door counterpart . 
the good reason . 
it upscal trend-driven market . 
even though mani model base sedan platform interior etc . 
good enough warrant slight higher price . 
here platform deriv i think tercel paseo sentra nx1600nx2000 civic del sol 323 mx-3 sure one stylus impulsestorm to illustr tercel start around 8000 paseo start around 11000 . 
even 4-door tercel cost less 2-door paseo . 
now might say tercel n't offer power 4-door offer . 
what i mean 4-dr tercel compar powerpl sport coup deriv . 
let 's take anoth exampl isuzu stylus xs impuls xsstorm gsi . 
both powerpl 1.6l 140hp engin smaller 2-dr coup general expens . 
again two-door sport coup market fashion-ori trend-set segment . 
peopl will pay money type car . 
in short even though sc1sc2 may smaller henc less car 's market orient dictat slight higher price mechan equival sedan sl1sl2 version . 
i hope clear thing bit ......
