militechtm yet anoth oil addit . 
but demonstr product realli impress n't cheat . 
the setup demo fair simpl . 
a cone shape rotor half submerg small oil sink fill motor oil . 
the rotor power electron motor . 
a metal pad press rotor use torqu wrench rotor stop friction . 
the torqu need stop rotor read torqu wrench . 
befor militech ad rotor stop 60 lb-ft torqu you pick brand oil differ . 
onc militech ad oil rotor could stop even 120 lb-ft torqu . 
here good part even salesman empti oil sink still could stop rotor thin film remain .
