the biggest problem peopl seem saturn dealer make 2k car . 
i think agre car compar price competitor n't overpr compar car class . 
i n't understand point argu whether dealer make 2k ? 
i never understood big deal dealer profit either . 
the thing i figur peopl believ minim dealer profit minim total out-of-pocket expens car . 
while may true case i believ general true . 
i bought saturn sl januari 92 . 
at that time base studi car price i decid compar car price cheapli saturn . 
sure mayb i could talk price car saturn price out-of-pocket expens would n't differ . 
what 's import much money i left i buy car . 
reduc dealer profit is not the same thing as save money ! 
show reduc dealer profit save money i ll believ 's import . 
my experi reduc dealer profit necessarili save money . 
fred say bought saturn 13k dealer profit 2k . 
if dealer profit 1000 would pay 12k car . 
so n't save money ? 
yes . 
but point price competet . 
saturn may well sell car intend give dealer 2000 profit sinc comper honda 500 profit expens may well worth buy saturn . 
moreov saturn realli reduc dealer profit margin 1000 car even better deal . 
say price saturn alreadi 1000 market averag class car reduc dealer profit would 2000 market averag . 
it 1 attract even peopl buy saturn would save them money . 
2 forc competitor lower price surviv . 
now saturn owner benefit lower dealer profit even buyer car pay less . 
not necessarili . 
it seem saturn salesdroid n't make commis wherea counterpart dealership general make per hour whatev . 
this mean saturn n't give profit employe commis is taken per- car profit . 
they pass along less pressur salesmenwomen . 
is n't save money ? 
mayb . 
mayb . 
depend account practic . 
i 'd rather pay dealer servic n't cut corner contain cost ...
