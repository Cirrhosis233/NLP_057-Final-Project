my point ? 
rbi might perfect stat noth . 
and stat lack tell clutch hitter . 
mayb stat can tell either peopl ... 
i know ! ! ! 
8 i hope somebodi would mention clutch . 
clutch ? 
baerga ? 
the two word simpli go togeth . 
with runner score posit baerga bat .308.366.418 last year . 
this n't quit suck batter hit better situat . 
alomar ? 
he hit .354.439.517 runner score posit ! 
the differ ? 
alomar 68 rbis 147 ab . 
baerga 81 rbis 182 ab . 
baerga got 25 chanc yet succeed 20 time . 
frank i n't believ clutch . 
but i vote would go alomar mvp let alon best 2b al .
