i think would least ahead ron santo . 
becaus small advantag field abil come nowher near make larg differ hit . 
their averag season use combin averag 656 ab bb per 162 game year ab h r 2b 3b hr rbi tb bb avg obp slg op santo 14.10 577 160 81 26 5 24 94 268 79 .277 .366 .464 .830 robinson 17.55 607 162 70 27 4 15 77 243 49 .267 .325 .401 .726 field per 162 game third year p a dp e pct santo 13.15 149 348 30 24 .954 robinson 17.72 152 350 35 15 .971 even robinson 's extra 3 putout 2 assist 5 dps taken mean respons 10 out field n't make extra 28 out made plate mention fewer total base . 
the differ .104 op decreas .025 account wrigley .079 differ still consider . 
the thorn palmer rate adjust adjust stolen field total product bat run base run run rate santo 123 284 -14 137 41.7 robinson 105 52 -5 151 19.8 26.3 usual disclaim tp 's fr appli realli n't way mark comparison . 
at least 's better field percentag carney lansford .966 10th best all-tim -225 fr dead last time . 
also sinc total rate compar player leagu averag instead replac level robinson award extra 6.5 play 653 game . 
he great career i would prefer santo 's plus 4 year replac level 3bman . 
but i would knock traynor list replac stan hack . 
that 's similar stori hack 's far better hit outweigh traynor 's superior field . 
graig nettl buddi bell would also better choic imho cours though recent net discuss support point view . 
cf 7 andr dawson should n't right field ?
