no .... hal mcrae worst manag basebal . 
i n't seen enough royal ' game judg tactic may point . 
but i ve never seen guy wast talent like . 
one best raw-tal staff leagu 's still find way lose . 
imo royal n't chanc win pennant even mcrae sudden began channel john mcgraw . 
ok decent pitcher . 
but offens consist bum like gagn lind mcreynold mcrae over-the-hil brett re go finish .500 unless mcgraw bring christi mathewson back . 
i 'd say hard evalu manag hitter suck .
