from anoth not-so-distressed-but-still-wondering-about-a-few-th cardin fan joe torr worst manag basebal . 
he 's greatest true . 
for anyon n't see sunday 's game i saw . 
with right hander pitch decid bench lankform left hand hitter play jordan gilkey right hander . 
lankford hurt although announc said told torr could pinch hit need . 
later ninth inning base load two out put lankford 300 hitter power pinch runner use lui alicea 250 hitter power pinch hitter . 
what hell think . 
i wonder thing . 
but give joe benefit doubt i 'd say think lankford hurt enough n't trust abil bat effect want speed base pinch run . 
alicea i complet confus . 
mayb good record hit particular pitcher ? 
i n't know . 
anybodi got idea ? 
earlier game interview acquir mark whiten comment fortun cardin get whiten whiten would regular even though meant gilkey would hurt but torr said like gilkey come bench . 
gilkey hit 300 last year start the guy would start everi team leagu . 
well far i n't seen much say whiten n't play bad gilkey odd man play jordan ahead . 
that i n't quit understand . 
furthermor sunday game lankford thrown plate the replay show bucki dent third base coach look line wave lankford home yup i look replay . 
if i 'm joe torr i 'm go talk bucki game one . 
he 's got lankford third todd zeil i believ hot hitter come 's reason risk give lankford go sign situat unless sure ball go stand . 
it 's job watch play develop known larkin back bad throw . 
that seem inexcus book . 
btw i saw dent thing last year zeil round third go sure home critic situat . 
on replay 's dent wave around . 
it look like might serious problem . 
the card 's n't good base runner last year i wonder much fault lie base coach . 
i ca n't take anymor well i 'm still hang . 
go redbird ! ! 
woof woof ! ! !
