write spanki slow ! 
if quicker would still . 
but slaught tom princ n't want lose princ order bring 11th pitcher . 
slaught good spanki princ come along nice ! 
tom princ 28 year old no-hit catcher . 
think young dann bilardello . 
or young don bordello ... 
i ca n't begin fathom pirat afraid lose guy 's aaa last 5 season . 
the pirat releas kirk gibson last year princ option eventu sent princ anyway clear waiver without peep . 
he 's anoth year older still ca n't hit think would n't clear waiver ? 
whi would care ? 
there 's strong possibl buc absolut catch prospect minor point least nobodi readi serious aaamajor duti . 
the main reason might stay princ could age especi spanki creep toward mid-30 someth . 
all thing consid though i 'd lot comfort spanki behind plate princ . 
is n't decent backup backstop look work ?
