excerpt netnews.rec.sport.basebal 1-apr-92 re nl east smiley op project 1992 hojo .792 i streak nake forb avenu hojo muster .792 op . 
someth wrong project . 
some predict need introduct ! 
do care put predict poster ? 
you predict mark grace get 90 rbis . 
i say mind . 
that almost imposs 10-hr type guy bat behind dawson . 
who kill ralli n't finish . 
whi say ? 
mark driven 82 90 79 89 . 
last year mark bat second primarili wors year averag wise . 
sinc bat either 3rd 5th year i predict back previous standard i think better 90 rbi 's much stretch . 
sometim us stathead get lucki . 
grace n't hit behind dawson entir season also finish 79 rbis . 
the ballsi predict ever mark mcgwire hit 61 hrs year . 
nope . 
he slow injuri finish . 
did n't even reach 50 . 
but ballsi predict nonetheless . 
1 baltimor fade . 
they win divis year finish within five game . 
i find prospect two oriol win 20 easier comprehend two sox . 
no offens i think pitch good divis offer . 
the oriol finish seven game . 
none 20 though mussina might chanc better relief start . 
2 nobodi els divis worth darn . 
they finish minimum fifteen game tribe 30 . 
that 's anoth reason watch baltimor year next wo n't wast mani game rest divis . 
except brewer probabl forgot right ! 
the rest divis thorough mediocr . 
the yanke indian led 76 win red sox trail 73 win . 
none horribl four five game .500 . 
date thu 6 aug 1992 154730 gmt right . 
that . 
i never said jay cinch clinch i said milwauke threat baltimor . 
i think toronto win 87 i n't consid anyth cinch unless someth like 4 game lead 3 game go . 
i think jay best talent team al east good even averag manag might bigger lead right . 
i also think oriol play much better .500 basebal rest season . 
you win ! 
7 . 
indian first 0-162 season ever ! 
predict the cleveland indian win 70 game next year . 
you right ! 
1 . 
jose rijo win 1992 cy young award if healthi enough go least 210 ip . 
who would thought would tri steal base ? 
whi risk injuri ? ? ? 
he 211 ip n't win cy young . 
maddux surpris . 
2 . 
the oriol win 88 game least 3 next 6 year probabl last 3 pitch staff team era among best 4 al least 3 next 6 year necessarili year win 88 . 
this one take long time verifi . 
i n't think i want wait long . 
but 89 game last year fifth leagu era . 
not bad start . 
4 . 
ben mcdonald challeng era titl next 2 year 18 victori either year . 
by challeng i mean finish among leader among leader befor season done n't count . 
he probabl never pitcher hype still decent starter . 
look like . 
he n't bad last year consist ace . 
so far year look like . 
5 . 
the philli give mani fewer walk ifwhen get rid bullpen coach ryan . 
i predict whether get rid give team littl bit time adjust see radic chang . 
they would fine pitch staff would steal ray miller away pittsburg . 
the white sox seem problem bad . 
i honest ca n't say . 
did get rid ? 
their bb total last year . 
7 . 
ricki jordan 90 rbi if start 145 game hit 3 4 5 spot lineup 6 spot lineup good obp 45 hitter . 
this appli next 3 year . 
i n't think 's good .... 
12 . 
billi ripken never hit .240 400 ab . 
so far good . 
i 'm definit wait check one . 
no matter lou gorman scout say paul quantril never ever adequ major leagu starter . 
never ! 
i never seen start pitcher strike 3 per 9 inning aaa success major . 
current plan seem use quantril long relief . 
he rubber arm unusu deliveri . 
he might decent role .
