i want let everyon know i lost littl respect i jim lefebvr see today 's cub game . 
first could start maldonado may . 
after way may play end last year way tore cactus leagu could let sit bench ? 
not mention right hander maddux start . 
i realli blew top lefebvr pinch hit rick wilkin tommi shield ! 
how lefty-righti thing much made . 
wilkin twice hitter shield . 
then next batter jose vizcaino one weakest hitter i ever seen look terribl bat day lefebr let hit may still sat bench . 
i think even arni harri stun show may sit dugout vizcaino bat . 
face lefebvr got worst manag basebal . 
a dishard cub fan
