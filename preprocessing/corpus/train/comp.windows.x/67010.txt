i use desqviewx i think great . 
where realli shine imho let unix user log pc run dos window applic display go screen . 
you ll need get desqviewx v 1.1 desqviewx v 1.1 275 suggest retail desqviewx other x system v 1.1 200 suggest retail you also must run support network ftp softwar pctcp novel lan workplac dos sun microsystem pc-nfs beam whitesid wollongong pathway tcpip hp microsoft lan manag n't network stuff quarterdeck give copi novel tcpip transprot dos network manag . 
in opinion want peopl log run applic pc ll want 486 33 16 meg ram . 
also xwindow softwar desqviewx realli seem like et 4000 tseng lab chipset base graphic card . 
person i found thing ran better scsi drive pc esdi drive experi what sort traffic generat x-call ? 
i curious find requir bandwidth link must one machin run dvx support multipl user client requir adequ respons time . 
anyon idea ? ? 
i expect limit factor server machin network . 
to give real-world exampl quarterdeck rough 100 peopl use dvx talk bunch unix box novel file server . 
it 's much load ethernet mayb 4 concentr 20-30 peopl segment . 
if bad load net app want run network intens could run slowdown . 
but biggest problem would machin . 
say 486 33 plenti ram fast hard disk network card . 
if 10 peopl run program re go see slowdown re effect 3.3 mhz 486 . 
of cours dvx attempt see task idl make sure give time slice 10 work program run ll know . 
have said tweak program run ad call give time slice idl sort thing could probabl run 15-20 peopl given machin start see slowdown time network bandwidth . 
it realli depend program ie . 
re go see slowdown x-bandwidth lot sooner app network thing also ...
