i applicationshel use colormap creat xcreatecolormap use color avail 8-bit display .... when i popup dialogshel prompt user input i want xmndialogstyl set xmdialogprimaryapplicationmod . 
the result cursor dialogshel i get colormap cursor applicationshel window dialogshel i get default colormap . 
but i 'd like cursor window applic i get colormap . 
i think correct behavior . 
rememb default colormapfocuspolici keyboard mean cmap focus follow keyboard focus . 
sinc dialog modal mwm wo n't allow keyboard focus onto main shell wo n't allow cmap focus either . 
sinc sound though keyboardfocuspolicypoint i suggest set colormapfocuspolicypoint also . 
that way cmap focus wo n't slavish follow keyboard focus beat path . 
keyboardfocuspolici explicit set cmap focus explicit also need bind f.focuscolor probabl mb1 .
