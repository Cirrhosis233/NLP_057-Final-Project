what sort traffic generat x-call ? 
i curious find requir bandwidth link must one machin run dvx support multipl user client requir adequ respons time . 
anyon idea ? ? 
i expect limit factor server machin network . 
to give real-world exampl quarterdeck rough 100 peopl use dvx talk bunch unix box novel file server . 
it 's much load ethernet mayb 4 concentr 20-30 peopl segment . 
if bad load net app want run network intens could run slowdown . 
but biggest problem would machin . 
say 486 33 plenti ram fast hard disk network card . 
if 10 peopl run program re go see slowdown re effect 3.3 mhz 486 . 
of cours dvx attempt see task idl make sure give time slice 10 work program run ll know . 
well i buy bigger power server machin signific drop price year year . 
the link i want use though isdn 64k cost bandwidth limit . 
that 's interest lie see link use see traffic goe . 
have said tweak program run ad call give time slice idl sort thing could probabl run 15-20 peopl given machin start see slowdown time network bandwidth . 
hmmm . 
has anyon centr monitor traffic ? 
are run standard ms-window program like word what sort packet go blaze ? 
what size link 2mb 10mb ? . 
what averag traffic flow go network high peak mani low point ? 
it realli depend program ie . 
re go see slowdown x-bandwidth lot sooner app network thing also ... 
what mean network thing ? 
i vision use ms window window applic network process run server i get display . 
i wonder good x subsequ dvx protocol transfer imag x-call display client 's machin .
