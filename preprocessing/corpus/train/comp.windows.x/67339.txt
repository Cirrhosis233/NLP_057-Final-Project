i 'm write x server video-gener equip . 
the hardwar truecolor yuv space x term 24-bit static color visual . 
i would realli like server present static visual i 'm sure accept x client . 
the three problem i see 1 the colormap though huge static . 
2 all pixel would 3 byte wide . 
3 becaus hardwar actual live yuv space translat rgb-yuv introduc round error . 
we tri ship x server support 24bit truecolor visual . 
the main problem encount 1 client written logic like follow defaultdepth 1 assum default depth 8bit these client need 8bit deep visual root window run correct . 
2 other client n't even bother much outright assum dynam visual class dynam colormap . 
xstorecolor n't work cmap associ static truecolor visual class mani client n't bother check start throw xstorecolor call . 
though clear client error case mani client 's easier expos 8bit pseudocolor default root window visual ever would client writer chang client right thing .
