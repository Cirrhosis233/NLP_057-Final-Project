two year ago i wrote sunview applic fast anim raster file . 
with sunview becom rapid obselet i ve final decid rewrit everyth scratch xview . 
i put togeth quick test i ve found xputimag consider slower factor 2 averag ? 
sunview command pwrop move imag data memori pixrect canva . 
this sparc ipx . 
it seem 1 x protocol communic slow thing 2 xputimag ineffici ... ! 
use xputimag sourc maintain client destin maintain server thus incur overhead transport whatev client-serv communic mechan use . 
is possibl maintain sourc imag pixmap ? 
these maintain server copi window much cheaper . 
also make sure send unnecessari xsync run xsynchon mode .
