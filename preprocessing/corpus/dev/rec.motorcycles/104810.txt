a random thought ride passeng there 's substitut bike suffici power taken passeng occasion small 125 etc bike i use ride uk hard i 'm ride gs1100 's great even move freind gsx600 i ride recent . 
this may due part fact neither i regular passeng particular slimlin i alway tell passeng stay line bike corner make movement predict . 
my regular passeng tend hold either rack noth i n't realli like passeng hold onto except short period . 
again may bias fact i ve coupl new passeng friend recent first time bike hold real tight make kind maneuv difficult . 
i ve also discov longer trip i prefer passeng move shift weight bit . 
i recent took work collegu meet 1 hour ride sat total still whole way left also sit still get sore back . 
we code system turn stop ' i need shift posit ' .
