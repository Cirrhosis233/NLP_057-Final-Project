1 . 
all us argu gyroscop etc . 
through understand techniqu counterst . 
includ one think counterst way corner ? ? 
well ... 
way decreasing-radius corner anyway ... 
this realli thing disagre . 
mayb agre disagre ? ? 
ok i 'm right ! 
the offici line though i doubt front brake appli first follow rear brake idea avoid lock rear weight transfer take place . 
if 's offici line taught rider educ class refer also n't teach counterst i question qualiti class . 
the offici line msf curricula i describ . 
maximum brake achiev appli brake equal weight distribut nomin even tire equal normal forc eas rear prevent lock increas brake front traction avail front due increas normal forc due weight shift . 
the offici line taught seem ineffect face . 
appli rear brake front take advantag traction avail rear time 0 halv avail brake power use front time 0 . 
say brake tire begin slide next useless advic newbi . 
he go slide tire find ! 
it also give zero inform develop brake techniqu chang brake correspond weight shift develop . 
if n't slide tyre way know whether ve achiev maximum brake . 
i 'm suggest alway aim brake hard possibl want find limit machin go beyond . 
not necessarili true . 
chirp tire indic impend lockup surfac serv good guid newbi indic maximum brake . 
i agre total lock front occasion make one better rider manuv best save experienc rider unless one outrigg bike like code use use . 
in case maximum brake i suggest aim keep wheel point slide ll exact suggest ! ! 
true point view best teach ride skill discuss start keep wheel point slide near useless inform . 
you need teach techniqu least strategi achiev .
