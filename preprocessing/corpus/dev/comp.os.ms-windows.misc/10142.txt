i eisa machin i understand eisa video card match perform isa counterpart . 
for instanc eisa orchid pro design iis- fast isa diamond speedstar plus n't i would call fast i n't understand eisa video card n't group level perform local bus card given eisa video card 32 bit bus move data around instead isa 's 8 bit . 
good question . 
answer the eisa bus move 32 bit rather isa 's 816 ? 
but still move speed isa bus . 
i think 's either 8 10 mhz . 
the local bus design also move 32 bit like eisa move data cpu speed 40 mhz . 
so 33mhz cpu local bus move 32bit data 33 mhz eisa move 32bit data 8 10 mhz . 
so local bus 3 4 time faster eisa 33 mhz cpu . 
eisa two mayb 3 time fast isa . 
i would expect eisa board twice fast isa board . 
not move data path twice wide least differ number clock requir bus transact two buss . 
most isa board requir multipl clock per bus transact typic around 3-4 . 
eisa board suppos abl burst ' 11 rate i would expect perform 6x-8x isa card . 
so i guess question unansw still . 
i would expect abl see 6x speed differ appar .
