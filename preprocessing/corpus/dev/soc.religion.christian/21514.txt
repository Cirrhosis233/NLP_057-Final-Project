i would like abl respond sens literaci maintain amiabl student-teach relationship . 
so common definit christian ? 
as previous discuss triniti lend exchang flame i hope also produc major flame . 
regard larri autri silicon graphic st . 
loui often get discuss christian . 
unfortun number possibl definit . 
start broadest common use definit histor definit peopl accept christ lord savior broad doctrin definit narrow doctrin definit 1 by histor definit i mean sort definit secular historian would like use . 
this would includ group develop christian church continu within broad cultur . 
e.g . 
unitarian would fail doctrin test could come . 
yet 's clear group develop christian peopl differ background e.g . 
hindus would like see part christian . 
this definit christian like 's relev polit ethnic context . 
2 accept christ lord savior test use mani christian group membership e.g . 
southern baptist presbyterian church usa . 
i would qualifi say peopl mind exclus commit christ someon accept christ one mani god would fit . 
it 's attempt formul criterion religi base technic doctrin . 
by definit group arian would view heret christian still christian . 
in modern context would includ mormon jw 's one pentecost . 
they would view heret christian still christian . 
in practic i believ everyon fall categori would accept apostl 's creed . 
3 the next level attempt give broad doctrin definit includ major strand christian exclud group felt outsid histor christian this cours slipperi enterpris sinc cathol could argu protest outsid histor christian etc .
