this paragraph brought mind question . 
how mormon reconcil idea etern marriag christ 's statement ressurect peopl neither marri given marriag luke chapt . 
20 ? 
well someth i wrote time ago respons similar question . 
i hope help begin repeat previous post as scriptur mention i agre seem problem etern marriag marriag general . 
luke 's version jesus say children world marri given marriag attain kingdom heaven . 
it almost sound like marriag disqualifi one salvat . 
matthew mark omit statement . 
i think account clear might . 
let 's look incid see come reason idea mean . 
the scriptur involv mat 2223-30 mark 1218-25 luke 2027-36 . 
what happen sadduce believ resurrect thought could trap jesus . 
they made refer leverit marriag requir brother man die without children take widow wife rais children . 
the children would consid children deceas though woman 's first husband father . 
it seem obvious woman still consid way wife first husband . 
howev sadduce concoct scene 6 brother deceas turn fail father children widow . 
they seem impli leverit marriag equal first ask whose wife shall resurrect ? 
at point seem obvious anybodi 's wife first husband . 
after born children would credit regardless brother biolog father . 
it possibl jesus refer say ye err know scriptur power god mat 2229 compar mark 1224 phrase luke 's account . 
anyway sadduce ask whose wife resurrect see 7 ? 
jesus answer in resurrect neither marri given marriag .. 
mat 2230 when rise dead neither marri .. 
mark 1225 they account worthi obtain world neither marri .. 
luke 2035 all 3 account go say angel heaven equival . 
i find last help sinc bibl defin angel give idea life like . 
some minist claim sexless differ human etc . 
i find biblic support .
