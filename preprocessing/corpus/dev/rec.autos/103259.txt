this tricki situat previous owner n't inform dealer odomet chang previous owner commit fraud may liabl . 
the dealer may also liabl if previous owner notifi dealer previous owner dash replac dealer previous owner dash chang legal record search car turn fact odomet alter . 
if dealer chang speedomet report goe car 's servic record manufactur titl i rememb correct dealer told old mileag etc . 
sent ford t-bird 's speedo replac . 
if odomet set old mileag must ca n't eg electrically-driven odomet mileag old odomet must written perman sticker affix door frame vehicl . 
either way chang done legal record search dealer almost certain turn . 
call state 's depart transportationpubl safetymotor vehiclesor tag agentto find certain right . 
your state 's attorney general know certain jame
