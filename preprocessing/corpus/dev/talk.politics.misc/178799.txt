sinc court suppos busi prevent parti reap windfal settlement parti settlement aris wrong act parti ? 
wdstarr sinc said boomer 's relianc econom led unjust result . 
i 'm point altern far unjust tradit sens world . 
atlant cement 's act wrong . 
it someth capitalist societi want build factori creat industri job . 
the cost complianc grossli disproportion damag face plaintiff . 
bang . 
here 's one place wide diverg . 
you believ court decid civil disput two parti consid factor perhap overrid factor issu i believ court ignor irrelev disput . 
boomer v . 
atlant cement co . 
action brought one parti boomer whose properti right violat ongo basi anoth parti atlant cement compani . 
the fact support boomer 's content atlant cement wrong damag properti boomer ask court order atlant cement stop . 
end stori . 
there reason court consid issu capitalist societi would want atlant cement whether cost complianc disproportion damag face plaintiff . 
those issu noth case court . 
bill govern step epa made regul requir multi-million dollar cement plant shut smatter cement dust cost-benefit ratio 151 'd arm . 
whi okay judici branch interfer way legisl execut branch ? 
i 'd arm ? 
whi assum ? 
quit contrari i 'd probabl support action sinc would base general doctrin decis i believ would correct boomer idea peopl 's properti right violat reason econom effici . 
in boomer boomer 's properti right i believ court protect hypothet epa rule ve present 's american peopl 's collect properti right healthi physic environ . 
what good cost-benefit ratio 151 wind cement dust air ? 
your rule make per se illeg ever oper cement plant . 
if state massachusett came similar regul 'd arm complain interfer properti right fifth amend violat . 
onc againwhi okay judici branch interfer way legisl execut branch ? 
or libertarian present ? 
ted frank how would per se illeg oper cement plant ? 
would n't mean buy land cement plant would either buy enough land pollut would stay land buy pollut easement surround landown ? 
tim smith all take one holdout hundr neighbor scrap plant . 
furthermor neighbor go want full benefit bargain result bilater monopoli . 
a bonanza lawyer sure get negoti agreement windfal homeown extort away profit plant would make particular good societi . 
yes . 
so ? 
the court suppos protect specif right individu general interest nebul societi . 
if societi cement plant without violat anyon 's right fine . 
otherwis societi somehow limp along one less cement plant . 
see ted i realli libertarian ! 
that 's whole point behind coas theorem . 
in world without transact cost land automat put best use transfer person person instantan without friction legal regim matter result . 
in world one transact cost one want legal regim approxim end result begin order minim transact cost . 
one want legal regim approxim end result begin order minim transact cost ? ? ? 
which one speak ? 
i want legal regim protect peopl 's right . 
besid coas 's theorem real applic never-nev land perfect ration actor . 
in real world 1 peopl go stubborn orneri spite otherwis irrat econom point view 2 purpos court protect right . 
i n't care show logic cattl 100 damag properti per head i ration sell graze right land say 150 per head i still retain right tell i plain n't want damn cattl properti price . 
and say everyon 's properti right protect plaintiff made whole unnecessari settlement cost avoid as i disput claim plaintiff made whole they fact court action depriv right owner properti choos sell sell properti price accept . 
wdstarr then argument tort plaintiff ever made whole award damag involuntari . 
whi treat nuisanc plaintiff differ tort plaintiff ? 
we n't requir specif perform analog contractu situat tort ? 
last question first for reason contract law would come danger close tread thirteenth amend . 
as then argument tort plaintiff ever made whole award damag involuntari claim re least partial right . 
face situat wrong alreadi done damag victim alreadi taken place revers undon court tri set equit price tag loss suffer victim requir wrongdoer pay price rather inflat price victim might prefer . 
in case sale alreadi taken place irrevers court simpli tri ensur fair price paid doctrin certain circumst even civil wrongdoer forc pay punit excess price b even genuin victim profit unjustifi inequit manner victimhood . 
both doctrin may worth discuss debat elsewher neither relev case like boomer wrong act loss stem still futur reversedundon i.e . 
prevent happen order court . 
in type case court requir potenti victim 's properti right protect unless agre sell mutually-accept price . 
there need court guess equit valu loss forc side accept find . 
it leav oper parti . 
and i ask sinc court suppos busi ensur unnecessari settlement cost avoid ? 
if i ve miseduc i alway thought court suppos busi ensur justic done . 
unnecessari settlement cost unjust punit . 
in case like boomer re simpli cost busi . 
the fact proprietor atlant cement co . 
got posit found barrel simpli result poor busi decis start cement plant without first tri negoti boomer everyon els whose properti right 'd violat via oper plant . 
there 's noth punit unjust . 
2 it complet sensibl believ alleg right owner atlant cement stay busi avoid lose lot money due wrong act alleg right sever hundr atlant cement employe job disappear trump right peopl properti damag atlant cement 's wrong act . 
wdstarr anybodi ever commit wrong act disgorg entir set possess wrong person ? 
were n't complain excess punit damag ? 
anybodi want commit wrong act futur requir buy right victim advanc . 
and seller allow set price privileg . 
no injustic punit damag . 
you 'd like posner bill . 
he 's libertarian . 
realli ? 
i n't know ... 
anyth say case like boomer ? 
wdstarr in eal cite exampl bilater monopoli court correct avoid . 
i 'm sure cover land posner book tort law presum favor i n't book front . 
doe n't sound much like libertarian . 
libertarian tend believ right individu peopl societi . 
i ve admit understand field general refer law econom weak . 
if advoc use econom analysi one mani tie-break factor court may use help reach decis case disput measur scale justic even balanc fine . 
but illustr boomer fine court start view econom case import justic case . 
wdstarr in case justic case intric tie econom case . 
atlant cement commit tort caus 185k damag . 
should pay million ? 
or compens damag commit ? 
as state tort ongo . 
atlant cement want abl continu violat boomer 's right . 
while court may justifi set equit price tag damag alreadi commit reason need set price tag futur violat boomer 's right forc boomer sell price .
