i realiz i 'm fight occam 's razor argument i ll tri explain i feel mind necessari . 
kevin unfortun delv field i know littl algorithm . 
your reason i see much along line roger penros claim mathemat insight ' algorithm book the emperor 's new mind concern comput mind law physic . 
howev penros 's claim mathemat insight similar claim wavefunct collaps conscious take look could illus . 
we obviouslu take differ viewpoint i tri ponder problem conscious evolutionari perspect realis might anyth special certain use . 
think back i wrote think worm mind ? 
they abl experi pain least behav like . 
yet conceiv might day futur perform total synthesi c . 
elegan element . 
would worm mind ? 
first i 'm impress abil algorithm . 
they re great solv problem method work work method . 
this true extent . 
howev i think brain work like comput . 
in fact substanti evid skarda 1985 skarda freeman 1987 brain work less chaotic generat enough random mental state evolv . 
our brain work much like genet algorithm generat i suppos . 
trick still form discov . 
doe mean idea ever alreadi pre-program brain ? 
this somewhat unlik given brain ultim encod 46 chromosom worth genet materi much n't use . 
inde extrem unlik given vast impact nurtur mind brain . 
i suggest howev tri understand conscious collect algorithm . 
kevin take look refer i mention think . 
i still think best expert natur conscious mind neurologist neuropsychologist biologist flame opinion sinc studi be conscious . 
the reason i repeat advic discuss lead anywher background differ . 
and pleas bring qm discuss physicist happi claim conscious play special role physic . 
i would say n't . 
the problem algorithm instabl . 
not mani algorithm surviv take larg portion code yet peopl surviv stroke without go complet haywir side-effect patient still seem remark stabl . 
also neuron perfect healthi peopl die alarm rate algorithm surviv i random corrupt various bit 's code ? 
again brain comput . 
do n't forget . 
this mean need someth els work work differ . 
their primari purpos ' percept guidanc action self-awar high intellig later appear . 
the next problem sticki question what colour ? 
replac colour ' sensat choic . 
presum materialist viewpoint 's product kind chemic reaction . 
the usual product reaction energi differ chemic . 
is colour mixtur ? 
you still expect could find idea green ' brain somewher perhap form chemic . 
this i see . 
the sensat green ' certain time-depend pattern area v4 visual cortex distribut help area v1 v2 rest brain . 
inde fire pattern . 
i sometim thought conscious global free induct pattern local fire pattern idl specul . 
scientif american 's septemb 1992 issu special issu mind brain . 
have alreadi read cover cover ? 
there two articl visual percept might interest . 
but pleas note subject experi observ third-person perspect . 
if see noth neuron activ go conclud mind . 
kalat 1988 write numer exampl electr stimul differ area brain led various chang patient ' state mind . 
for instanc patient whose septal area stimul without knowledg remot control psychiatr interview quick cure depress start discuss plan seduc girlfriend .

in conclus evid 1 brain essenti necessari subject experi brain damag usual equival sort mind damag 2 conscious process involv substanti brain activ various area brain think colour visual cortex activ etc . 
3 conscious afterthought becom conscious action half second delay brain ahead conscious ' least 350 ms . 
thus i think fruit turn question whi ' i ' see colour around ask what ' i ' seem observ ? 
sinc seem conscious mind king brain . 
if comput wo n't see colour chemistri differ . 
doe algorithm see colour select advantag equival n't ? 
it n't output algorithm ought equival circumst . 
so see colour ? 
this depend meant see colour ' . 
doe neural network capabl recognis handwritten number 0 9 see number capabl sort ? 
if ask anim conscious observ evolutionari advantag anim n't i good answer read previous post i wrote sens ident help social anim swap role act moral n't unconsci kill newli discov weapon . 
a bit extrem basic idea . 
when earli homo becam effici use tool sens ident concept self ' evolv line develop . 
inde respect other conscious altruist behaviour might evolutionari advantag social anim earli human . 
if i rememb correct quantum mechan consist wavefunct two process act . 
the first process call unitari evolut ' ' u ' govern schroeding 's equat well known . 
the second process call various thing collaps wavefunct ' state vector reduct ' ' r ' mysteri . 
it usual said occur measur ' take place although nobodi seem know precis occur . 
when occur effect r abrupt chang wavefunct . 
if mind requir mean human mind came scene wavefunct never collaps remain superposit aeon ? 
my power . 
this discuss i think topic irrelev sinc agre mind necessari neither physicist . 
anyway i 'm specul mind would part x . 
there seem link conscious r never see linear superposit anyth although altern explain . 
i ve idea brain suppos access part x sinc specul wo n't matter much my main point might place mind physic . 
i agre sens appar mean physic need sharp mind solv mani real problem . 
i ll go back nice pad cell 's ok it 's ok n't forget take refer i wrote previous post plus follow kalat jame w .
