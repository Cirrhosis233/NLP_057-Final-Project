ok montreal ! 
they deserv get first goal overtim wave puck hit high stick . 
their second goal overtim also replay i could tell montreal player kick . 
the puck definit direct stick . 
anyway montreal back seri . 
the overhead replay pretti clear show quebec defend deflect puck . 
the re-play offici take near much time make call first non-goal seem pretti non-controversi . 
i agre great game good see roy damphouss back form . 
hope sign good thing come ...
