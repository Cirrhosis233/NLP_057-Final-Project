bleep ! 
bleep ! 
bleep ! 
the bruin lost again o.t . 
i ca n't stand ! 
asid frustrat rave i must give buffalo credit make good score opportun play great defens . 
boston player ca n't seem get control puck anywher near buffalo net except rare occas . 
the buffalo defens also excel job clear away rebound . 
fuhr play great big save need 's also get plenti help . 
boston play rather well better would indic seri score 3-0 lack extra drive earlier part game . 
as result boston keep leav ice end 1st period 2 goal . 
this must stop boston hope win singl game outlook bruin 's advanc second round quit bleak . 
imho bruin need score first . 
if excel chanc win sinc outplay sabr 2nd 3rd period . 
the scari thing i ll go grad school buffalo next year . 
i ll never cheer sabr ... 
you ca n't convert ...
