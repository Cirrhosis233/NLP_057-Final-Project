i like clark-williams-bond order . 
pitcher walk clark 2 out unlik last year . 
william get better pitch hit bond loom on-deck circl . 
sinc matt terribl bat eye help giant lot . 
when bond get base tri steal 2nd driven singl thompson manwar clayton . 
if bat bond slugger n't want run caught steal could take big inning . 
also bond less need protect behind good base stealer walk potenti doubl . 
the draw back clark william clog base infront bond ... 
i think 's problem giant glad see especi robbi thompson get hot .
