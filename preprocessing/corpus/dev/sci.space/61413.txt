sci.spac reader skip first paragraph yesterday respons henri spencer 's question temperatur blackbodi interstellar space i said dust grain act blackbodi re 40-150 k well i dead wrong . 
our local interstellar dust expert bruce drain inform dust grain n't good radiat far ir warm actual ambient radiat field distant star bring true blackbodi 3 4 kelvin . 
sorri henri anyon els i misl . 
obvious time take anoth ism class in news alan stern southwest research institut gave talk pluto-charon binari system yesterday . 
he gave brief overview currently-accept system paramet volum ratio 81 mass ratio 151 plus lot ... 
gave thought format pluto-charon . 
his idea lot lot small planetesim outer solar system mass distribut power law kind time planetesim accret larger bodi . 
most got scatter solar system close encount jupit saturn mani accret gas giant especi uranus neptun . 
a larg planetesim captur neptun call triton captur ? 
perhap collis smaller already-exist neptunian moon perhap close passag neptun 's atmospher mondo aerobrak ! . 
he note two recent discov kuiper belt object 1992 qb1 1993 fw plus chiron pholus mass identifi group one-accretion-down larger bodi triton plutocharon . 
plutocharon think form impact bodi hit proto-pluto knock materi ring around pluto later accret charon similar idea format earth 's moon . 
there good evid spectra surfac pluto charon differ pluto methan frost charon n't use evid impact theori . 
he believ may around 1000 pluto-to-chiron-s object remain relat stabl dynam zone outsid neptun 's orbit beyond 35 au . 
1992 qb1 1993 fw first member popul found model . 
note bodi dark sinc surfac cover methan frost photolyz dark long-chain hydrocarbon . 
the reason pluto high albedo around 0.5 i think surfac warm just enough around perihelion sublim atmospher freez thirti year later form bright new frost . 
so bodi much farther away 30 au go hard see . 
i hope i n't made error transcript see howl mistak 's undoubt mine . 
by way 's one top gun behind pluto fast flybi mission i think said current plan use titan 4 send probe rectilinear trajectori pluto speak loos time .... 
he 'd like use proton give slight smaller veloc cost much less . 
his figur 500 million 2 titan 4 launch two separ probe launch separ 120 million 2 proton launch . 
he told stori soviet origin offer sell proton launch 30 million forc increas price us order allow marketplac . 
i 'm tell said .
