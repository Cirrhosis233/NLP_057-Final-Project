... 
but tri land shuttl big huge telescop back could problem . 
the shuttl n't design land much weight payload . 
is hst realli much heavier spacelab ? ? ? 
i hate belabor obvious orbit emerg earli stage origin hst deploy mission would had land hst bay . 
inde worri . 
one concern possibl would lose motor someth way make orbit one low give hst use lifetim atmospher drag . 
i believ decis deploy hst even project lifetim short six month . 
in fact got excel orbit upper envelop shuttl . 
i never heard serious consider hst might brought refurbish . 
you would horrend cost transport clean re-test re-certifi hardwar ground addit lost observ time cost second deploy mission risk might get good orbit second time . 
and would probabl still need third servic mission year gyro compon wear . 
better two servic mission space could well happen bring hst take .
