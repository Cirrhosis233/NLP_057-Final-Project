the atari 2600 use 6502 cpu like entir 8-bit line 400 80012001400 1440 130xe 65xe comput well 5200 game machin . 
wrong 6507 . 
for would like know 6507 6502 without irq nmi 13 address line give 8k memori space . 
it one custom chip asic sens word understood tia sometim known 6526 although manufactur list cia complex interfac adapt . 
tia stand televis interfac adapt handl sound paddl minim video hardwar 2600 possess . 
did n't know call 6526 that cia found commodor 64 i n't believ chip exist 2600 around . 
the tia map bottom 128 byte page 0 shadow bottom 128 byte page 1 . 
to get imag screen wait raster line pictur start load bitmap line sprite ' regist tell x posit take mani duplic want etc next line . 
this took processor 's time visibl portion display . 
there also standard 6532 ram io timer riot plus voltag regul memori serv 555 timer . 
that 's . 
the ram map top 128 byte page 0 shadow page 1 . 
the 6502 zero-pag address mode instruct shorter faster normal one import machin like scratchpad ram page 0 . 
unfortun also want stack page 1 stack pointer 8 bit high byte address hardwir 1 . 
the iot section map page 2 somewher . 
2 8 bit io regist ca n't rememb bit could independ set i o like 6522 6526 1 ? 
8 ? 
bit timer programm prescal i think power 2 . 
there interrupt system mani game would set timer known time go away someth els sit wait timer run . 
there logic box address decod riot least 2 chip select pin probabl one activ high one activ low i imagin tia much . 
various address line fed direct chip select . 
the 6507 like rom right top memori 2600 use rom activ high chip select exact normal cartrig 7404 convert usual activ low chip select .
