i 'm wonder 's possibl use radio wave measur distanc transmitt receiv ? 
seem abl measur signal strength determin distanc . 
this would short distanc 2000 ft i would need accuraci 6 inch . 
this would suscept fade multi-path etc . 
we use use system shop made telluromet south africa . 
it use 10 ghz signal 2 unit across distanc measur . 
the 10 ghz carrier real signal sever switch one around 7.5 mhz whose relat phase receiv would read digit distanc 10 cm need . 
the unit came psychromet sp ? 
measur relat humid instruct correct measur due rh temp . 
they rather heavi requir oper end . 
current technolog use polar reflector dual polaiz txrx psuedo-random code radar puls . 
resolut x band much better 47ghz . 
onli one end heavi nation water research institut burlington ontario canada .
