one not-so-quick question throw guy ... 
for class project need design build power suppli follow spec voltatg adjust 1-12v current limit 1a voltag must stay within 2 design valu i 0-1a ac rippl less 5 mv rms of cours ca n't use adjust voltag current-limit regul chip our problem current limit i.e . 
ve found stuff rest part circuit . 
what suppli must present load would draw 1a given suppli voltag reduc voltag current equal one amp . 
thus short thing ammet read one amp . 
if measur current 1 ohm resistor 12v read one amp output voltag necess must 1v . 
the basic idea seen current limit involv circuit pull current base output power transistor therefor reduc output . 
so anybodi idea could work ? 
thank advanc . 
andi collin kc6yey ps if anybodi want flame stupid project i agre fulli i still grade you design ramp shutoff brick-wal current limit even fold-back cutoff .... sound like want brick-wal current limit . 
your lead correct pull bias seri regul base drive . 
in order get brick -wall need enough voltag gain current sensor . 
normal darlington current sens resistor adequ infinit gain .. 
use op amp sens current releat stabl voltag refer use driver turn base bias series-pass transistor . 
phase compens may necessari close loop control system yopu 180 degre phase shift feedabck circuit uniti gain ok ? ?
