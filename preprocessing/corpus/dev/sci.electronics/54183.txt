i hate hard copi manual would rather doc onlin i want copi program usual faster conveni sift old book i ca n't find . 
just mho i prefer hardcopi book three four open spread across bed next desk dorm refer use program full-screen . 
the window help thing come closest good on-lin document i ve seen general n't detail enough would probabl take larg amount space even compress premium system .. 
in fact manual primari reason i bought borland 's c compil instead use one lab licens lab cours . 
i ve got shelf full book help i 'm stuck . 
to it also much easier scribbl correct hard-copi manual .
