i 'm wonder 's possibl use radio wave measur distanc transmitt receiv ? 
yes . 
it 's call radar . 
well actual quit . 
both radar radio-altimet measur distanc measur time requir transmit signal receiv reflect target . 
radar general use puls radio altimet use either puls modul continuous-wav transmiss . 
in case latter high accur distanc measur made . 
as exampl origin bendix ala-52 radio altimet accur 18 foot 2500 feet altitud . 
note howev differ method measur poster origin ask . 
the problem gain accur measur transmitt seper receiv need high accur time base start receiv exact instant transmitt trigger . 
this wire connect sinc radio wave actual travel faster free-spac air case wire differ call veloc factor cabl . 
so need resort common timebas automat correct distanc etc . 
someth like pll connect gps receiv trick trigger transmitt receiv simultan . 
sound expens ? 
not bad plan spend buck equip effort . 
whi go differ method ? 
surveyor use laser-light system reflect time measur . 
whi tri ? 
sound like someth p.e . 
know anyway - . 
seem abl measur signal strength determin distanc . 
this would short distanc 2000 ft i would need accuraci 6 inch . 
this actual high inaccur sinc power output transmitt vari unit unit varianc antenna transmiss line receiv may also vari unit unit unit time . 
you would need continu calibr entir system . 
with radio altimet also done sinc everyth locat one place much easier . 
note especi time base r.a . 
receiv transmitt one unit also ... 
depend environ static environ waveguid yes dynam environ object move multipath kill concept . 
nope . 
fm captur effect say strongest signal win . 
that unless two interf signal seper 3 db signal strength . 
this one problem make altimet inaccur low altitud . 
signal bounc runway tend veri strong ... 
what frequenc would best ? 
or matter ? 
as high possibl elimin outsid influenc also enhanc attenu multipath signal . 
radio altimet typic use frequenc around 4 ghz . 
hope help ...
