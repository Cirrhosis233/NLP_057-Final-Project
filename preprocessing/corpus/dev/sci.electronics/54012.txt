i 'm wonder 's possibl use radio wave measur distanc transmitt receiv ? 
seem abl measur signal strength determin distanc . 
this would short distanc 2000 ft i would need accuraci 6 inch . 
you might tri look what avail laser locat system . 
they work best close work 1 mile . 
rf use much longer distanc two major mode . 
transpond phase measur . 
transpond requir send puls anoth station return measur round trip time minus receiv time . 
phase measur requir two transmit station send frequenc signal multiplex time . 
a receiv pick measur phase shift signal . 
map drawn plot line posit correspond certain phase shift two station .
