dave c johnson i think mean ethernet number . 
the 8 byte ethernet id uniqu electron serial number esn assign ethernet board exist . 
this physic layer concept . 
the ip address higher layer protocol . 
the analog telephon servic ip address phone number particular wire pair cabl pole unknown i physic identif scheme number . 
but answer question assum inde meant ethernet number suppos possibl chang number . 
of cours manufactur alway retro-fit board could hard reason ever . 
if question actual refer ip address definet changabl . 
but strict softwar .
