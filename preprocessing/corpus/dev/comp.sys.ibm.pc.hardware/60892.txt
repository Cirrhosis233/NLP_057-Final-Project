hst oper 9.6 14.4 16.8 one direct low-spe back-channel direct . 
high-spe channel goe direct higher data flow . 
fine re log say bbs type one letter get screen info back transfer file use bimodem etc .... 
cours penalti turnaround time high-spe channel need revers direct . 
v.32 v.32bis symmetr mean transfer full data rate direct time . 
third synchron vs asynchron absolut noth symmetr vs asymmetr ... two complet differ topic . 
the hst 's upgrad v.fast spec avail .
