suppos knew algorithm work knew n chip know f cryptanalysi might abl determin f law enforc field eek u n f know n would might make much harder . 
they re bet ca n't even know n . 
even know e fact re tri keep secret . 
if find e grind chip presum find f well . 
but ca n't right des even know encrypt method without almost whole 56-bit search . 
that true chosen plaintext attack des key determin without full search . 
now suppos i know f either legitim if i know k either i involv convers i know u parti convers i may abl determin u parti . 
again re bet ca n't find u given k i.e . 
claim encrypt strong . 
trust us ... 
i will take bet . 
if i know f i also defeat law enforc field sinc i could make differ k one i use . 
know f also allow traffic analysi perform . 
so i might know say i could know say . 
i 'm sure ll way shove arbitrari key data chip part 's ok . 
we re assum e unknown . 
you obvious shove arbitrari data chip ...... 
as key state sesion key exchang extern chip i pick key . 
now i admit someon tri comput u lot messag work sinc way know key generat method deliber ? 
generat weak key matter publish method fact use perhap u 's chosen know weak key system . 
they assum wo n't abl find u matter mani messag . 
if could break u would n't need key escrow . 
bing bing bing bing bing that exact my point sinc we cant know that they do not have this capabl the onli safe assumpt is that they do ... 
admit cryptograph complaint probabl unfound sinc cant know one way im gonig take word .... 
obvious compromis f would disast law enforc whole thing design peopl believ give secur . 
f one number i sure alot peopl 1 know panel expert go check flaw mani know f forget grind chip briberi blackmail work fine . 
it 's clear expert told f . 
in fact i 'd surpris . 
i 'd expect someth form fip pub describ des could look algorithm general rather specif set key chosen . 
oh come that like say could evalu des without s-box constant .....
