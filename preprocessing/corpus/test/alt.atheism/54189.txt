o'dwyer say specif i 'd like know relativ conclud two peopl grotesqu disagre . 
is both right b one wrong sometim though perhap rare pretti good idea c one wrong never inform make best guess realli must make decis . 
the idea right moral judgement meaningless impli whether peac better war e.g . 
meaningless question need discuss correct answer e someth els . 
a short posit assert would nice . 
as i hope tell b c actual predic assumpt valu real statement like ca n't consist deriv relativist assumpt valu n't part object realiti . 
i relativist would like answer question way phrase question make unanswer . 
the concept right wrong correctincorrect truefals belong domain epistemolog rather moral question . 
it make sens ask moral posit right wrong although legitim ask good better anoth posit . 
let illustr point look psycholog deriv epistemolog ethic percept motiv respect . 
one certain ask percept right correct true verid wrong incorrect fals illusori . 
but make littl sens ask motiv true fals . 
on hand strang ask whether percept moral good evil one certain ask question motiv . 
therefor suggest answer a-c simpli ca n't consid assum judg correct moral judgment . 
now problem double-barrel i agre first part right moral posit meaningless question reason state . 
but irrelev alleg implic implic one feel peac better war . 
i certain make valu judgment bad better best without assert correct posit . 
sorri lengthi dismiss a-d . 
my short e answer two individu grotesqu disagre moral issu neither right correct wrong incorrect . 
they simpli hold differ moral valu feel .
