the way theori proven fals . 
you examin predicit theori make tri observ . 
if n't 
observ thing theori predict would n't happen evid theori . 
if theori ca n't modifi incorpor new observ say fals . 
but one handl nonrepeat experi ? 
in mani type experi predict observ phenomena happen capabl observ . 
for exampl chemistri someon may predict outcom chemic reaction actual observ reaction repeat . 
there sever problem . 
first discuss experiment procedur . 
observ procedur also use . 
the main criterion attempt verifi idea use make predict as-yet unmad observ . 
the observ could result experi 
could obsev activ occur spontaneossli natur 
could even observ last result event long past . 
all matter observ new . 
this predict scienc predict futur except restrict sens . 
second repeat also take mani form . 
it realli requir independ observ abl verifi result . 
the observ fossil repeat ' sinc qualifi observ may look specimen reqtin museum . 
also implicit predict futur fossil find correspond current one . 
new fossil found often enough test regular . 
mani time new fossil actual falsifi conclus made basi previous fossil . 
unfortun model falsifi alway peripher model evolut . 
for instanc front leg tyrannosaurus rex turn tremend muscl rather weak endow previous believ . 
so fact histoirc scienc find repeat necessari sens . 
just becuas go repeat origin event make imposs make valid observ . 
this say biologist would go coo-coo extra- terrestri life discov could make determin process abiogenesi relat easi .
