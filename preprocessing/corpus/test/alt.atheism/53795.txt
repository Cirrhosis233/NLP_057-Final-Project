i write imagin 1000000 alterian dollar turn bank account everi month . 
suppos money paid big-heart alterian benefactor b bug alterian atm . 
let 's suppos true dichotomi papb1 . 
troubl alterius differ univers observ alterius possibl except bank could n't possibl afford now let 's examin case . 
there evid whatsoev thing big-heart alterian benefactor . 
howev pexistsb-h a b pnotexistsb-h a b 1 . 
on ground lackofevidencefor evidenceagainst partit like dismiss hypothesi . 
turn therefor b also find evid support hypothesi . 
on ground dismiss hypothesi b . 
the problem dismiss possibl hypothes even though know construct money arriv everi month proven ca n't dismiss potenti caus . 
that 's extrem poor argument 's . 
premis 1 ... money paid either big- heart alterian benefactor b bug alterian atm . 
thus month appear buck happen observ alterius construct evid exist either benefactor bug atm . 
premis 2 observ alterius possibl . 
except bank could n't possibl afford you forgot includ . 
my premis actual premis 2 the cardin set possibl observ alterius one . 
this clear contradictori first . 
not state proper . 
troubl basi premis 2 say evid either benefactor bug first premis lead conclus appear buck happen evid exist either benefactor bug . 
voila scream contradict . 
highlight sc but strawman argument . 
there evid oneofbenefactorbug . 
no observ distinguish benefactor bug possibl . 
that evid bug neither evid benefactor . 
nor true say hypothet univers appear exact benefactorbug two statement would fals . 
this still contradictori . 
it reduc 1 alterian dosh arriv account due benefactor bug . 
2 evid benefactor neither evid bug mean n't lend weight one 3 therefor evid exist benefactor evid exist bug . 
but 3 reli shift mean 2 . 
when say paraphras 2 evid benefactor exampl mean 's evid benefactor bug . 
yes 's i mean . 
in 3 howev ve shift mean evid benefactor mean absolut ' evid benefactor rather relat ' evid benefactor w.r.t . 
bug . 
not realli i meant evid would tend one . 
i think communic problem . 
what i tri say clumsi way i buy theori far relat theism make predict prayer raptur ' exampl i n't buy use occam 's razor case a0 . 
in exampl one could n't dismiss benefactor bug ground simplic one necessari explain dosh . 
i brought one-by-on dismiss ' process show would wrong . 
from re say post seem agre re talk cross-purpos . 
3 still contradict 1 . 
some sum may help . 
with b benefactor b bug dosh arriv account 1 impli pbb 1 assum pbb 0 's either benefactor bug respons buck arriv pbb pb pb pb pb 1 3 impli pb 0 pb 0 . 
no n't i meant . 
pb 0.5 pb 0.5 necessarili new observ ve alreadi seen dosh chang estim . 
i tri say clumsi way would wrong assign 0 probabl either . 
and 's precis use razor case god god one class hypothesi mani other belong set hypothes oneofwhich necessari explain someth otherwis would satisfactorili explain . 
it thrown retain ground non-rat prefer scienc statist . 
altern one could chuck retain lot ground answer ca n't known notion probabl estim effect useless equal agnosticismweak atheism . 
as set m fill univers caus x x god pink unicorn noth etc . 
observ tend one conclus . 
exact point i make i think . 
so n't throw contrari assert . 
some peopl simon think excel scienc . 
my sole point n't . 
onli observ direct contradict hypothesi hi i.e . 
x px hi 0 caus phi go zero finit number observ . 
onli case get throw hypothes . 
exact point though i may unclear . 
you said diametr opposit i guess sourc confus . 
i mere tri illustr incorrect . 
what i 'm tri say correct say absenc evid sometim evid absenc hold true perhap version theism n't true hold discard use razor . 
on contrari hold exact discard use razor . 
see post branch thread . 
then seem guilti contradict accus . 
if razor hold god hold like hypothes . 
which mean re assign px hi 0 though ve alreadi establish 's correct sumpxhi1 . 
simpli put anyon claim viabl proof exist non-exist god whether induct best mistaken worst bark mad . 
luckili i make claim specif said much numer occas . 
you would n't construct strawman would frank ? 
although n't cours rule bark mad case i could bark mad spare time apolog clees et al . 
but i think miss point . 
when i say someth evid hypothesi n't impli observ said someth necessarili falsifi hypothesi reduc estim ph data zero . 
if reduc quantiti 's still evid h . 
no i got . 
i 'm talk case a0 . 
you re clear correct a ! 0 . 
and i 'm construct strawman though 's certain possibl i ve misunderstood re say . 
howev standard system say a0 god high unlik a ! 0 god dismiss use razor system purport induct proof god either n't exist unnecessari explain phenomena . 
in experi system includ purport prove god exist alway contain fallaci upon close examin . 
if 's re say pleas put straight .
