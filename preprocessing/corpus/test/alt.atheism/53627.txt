vonroeschlaub wrote well suppos probe emit radiat constant frequenc sent toward black hole . 
as got closer event horizon red shift would keep increas . 
the period would get longer longer would never stop . 
an observ would observ probe actual reach event horizon . 
the detect energi probe would keep decreas would n't vanish . 
exp-t never quit reach zero . 
that 's kind i meant . 
to precis given observ singl posit outsid event horizon would observ ever way abl detect probe cross event horizon ? 
yes unless observ rest respect singular infinit distanc away . 
but observ close approach bh see particl go finit time .
