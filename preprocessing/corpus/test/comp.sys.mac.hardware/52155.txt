i purchas 2x8 mb 72-pin 60 ns simm quadra 800 chip merchant i ve satisfi past . 
either one alon work togeth fail . 
i call appl advic told problem composit simm . 
onli non-composit simm use q-800 . 
chip merchant confirm present sell composit 72-pin simm . 
so q-800 simm need 60 ns non-composit . 
8 mb simm composit simm although mani ? 
16 mb simm . 
72-pin simm allow two memori bank per simm thus permit use 4 mb dram devic one use 4 mb simm use two 4 mb bank one simm . 
i ca n't imagin would cheaper build 8 mb simm use 1 mb dram 4 mb part reach exceed bit bit price pariti 1 mb part time ago . 
it 's probabl possibl build single-bank 8 mb simm use 4 mb part could caus problem q800 . 
i 'm sure 'd want though dual-bank 8 mb simm would cheaper build single-bank composit one .
