your sourc wrong . 
the doubl speed cd300 still slow compar typic hard disk . 
the lc easili handl scsi transfer rate cd300 . 
none current mac even quadra support scsi-2 unless get scsi-2 nubus card . 
you n't doubl speed use photocd . 
it 's faster read imag disk . 
i think cd150 handl photocd singl session . 
the cd300 multisess photocd .
