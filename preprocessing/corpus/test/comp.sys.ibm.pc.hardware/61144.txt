lpt1 no . 
in standard isa bus one almost non-laptop pcs use two separ interfac card share interrupt . 
this due screwup bus design . 
for exampl soundblast want drive interrupt number 7 must hold certain bus wire 0 1 time depend whether want interrupt . 
this preclud let anoth card assert interrupt number 7 . 
when two devic isa bus pc share interrupt 's re implement singl card . 
interest . 
would care explain soundblast pro card printer card share irq 7 success ? 
i assur set irq 7 i problem . 
my comput dtk 286-12 ibm clone . 
simpl . 
first andrew correct although i see might confus . 
it inde possibl two card configur use interrupt . 
they share interrupt sens possibl card activ time . 
here exampl . 
for time i short free interrupt i tape control floppi tape need one irq0-irq7 . 
it 's old tape drive . 
my solut use irq3 also use com2 modem . 
i i reason i would never use modem tape simultan . 
when kermit run instal interrupt handler irq3 use serial port . 
if tape drive generat interrupt kermit would clue withfor tape control . 
and sinc tape control would servic would like hang likewis tape backup softwar run instal interrupt handler irq3 . 
that handler wo n't anyth serial port . 
under dos print not interrupt-driven . 
instead bio poll status parallel port determin anoth byte may sent . 
that 's sound card lpt1 configur use irq7 . 
tri nt see far ll get .
