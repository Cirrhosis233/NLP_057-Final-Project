ide also use dma techniqu . 
i believ floppi control also use dma ad board also use dma . 
dma big deal noth direct scsi . 
no . 
the simpl 25 style ide control use dma . 
the cpu perform data transfer string move instruct . 
this requir cpu stop transfer data . 
onli smart drive control ide scsi transfer via dma . 
these control tend cost wether ide scsi . 
to get dma benefit ide must sacrific 's price advantag control . 
for exampl rewind format tape command issu control bus releas allow access devic bus . 
this great increas product least someth els back hard drive - . 
which happen i read group . 
you thank softwar . 
if dos brain could format floppi etc . 
someth els . 
the hardwar support dos least wo n't . 
again noth scsi . 
floppi n't ide bus arguement make sens n't ide issu . 
the floppi processor control board handl command . 
the differ ide scsi scsi peripheri intellig . 
they control . 
they depend cpu fewer thing i.e . 
ide drive need processor transfer data . 
it long stori i still use ide 486 except cdrom thank scsi i move machin . 
if scsi better standard support ibm-clon machin i plan complet get rid ide . 
and stick dos ll wonder ca n't multitask . 
again i ask ca n't unix os2 type os miracul thing ide harddriv singl scsi hard drive . 
the dettachcallback mechan alow cpu make request devic scsi bus dettach go busi . 
later devic done issu callback say data arriv function complet . 
most scsi card also dma data memori without interupt cpu therefor allow continu work uninterupt . 
ide support concept dettachcallback . 
can see would win multitask system ? 
david willmor david willmor ever notic much look like orchid ? 
love !
