do scsi card dos system requir separ devic driver load memori scsi devic hook ? 
no . 
all i ve seen also on-board bio enabl use 2 hard drive direct dos 2 drive dos limit problem ide standard matter . 
softwar driver often allow better perform though . 
you use want use devic besid hard disk 2 disk . 
will also true 32-bit os 's ? 
obvious abl use 16-bit real mode bios written dos need softwar driver . 
that 's big deal long driver avail wo n't fight low memori problem either .
