so ve got multi-task want increas perform increas amount overlap . 
one way dma bus master . 
either make possibl io devic move data memori without interrupt cpu . 
the altern cpu move data . 
there sever scsi interfac card allow dma bus master . 
how bus-mast isa bus ? 
as earlier post note dma . 
ide howev defin standard at interfac creat ibm pc at requir cpu move data byte dma . 
if re talk isa at bus 1 dma channel activ one time presum transfer data singl devic . 
so even though least 7 devic scsi bus explain 7 devic dma transfer singl scsi card isa-at bus time . 
ani one time mean imho singl byte xfer . 
if i four sourc dma request readi dma would servic one . 
if bandwidth four togeth lower isadma bandwidth work . 
note bus master prioriti mechan dma control .
