i ! 
i ide dros box ide scsi unix box . 
ide dros box cos hard disk scsi unix box cos scsi hard disk cd-rom tape . 
i bought scsi make ad mani devic easier . 
for price one irq dma i three differ type devic connect . 
faster drive also avail scsi i dec dsp3085s reali 9ms averag seek time . 
i.e find data 25 faster 12ms toshiba drive . 
like lot peopl i 'd realli like increas data transfer rate hard drive . 
right i 15ms 210mb ide drive seagat 1239a standard ide control card isa 486-50 . 
i n't think scsi increas data transfer much isa bus i 'm current think ad anoth hd 300mb 500mb rang . 
and i 'm think hard buy scsi drive scsi futur benefit . 
i believ i 'm get someth like 890kbsec transfer right accord nu . 
890kbs pretti good ... 
how would number compar i bought state-of-the-art scsi card isa pc state-of-the-art scsi hard drive best system i could hope ? 
mani state art scsi disk use same mechan mani state art ide drive . 
onli interfac electroni differ look 520mb fijitsu drive exampl ! 
obvious money factor choic well would you want use isa system ? 
and much would cost ? 
i use adaptec 1542b unix box no-nam ide card . 
along line kind transfer rate could i see ide hd 's i buy top-of-the-lin ide cach control 200mb 15ms hd ? 
and much would cost ? 
cach control ! 
whi ? 
what give smartdriv dos ? 
about 30kb extra lower memori ! 
that 's . 
a proper configur main memori cach produc better result cach control ! 
my unix read read data main memori cach 8.5mbs ! 
that 's faster standard isa bus ever sustain !
