can anyon explain fair simpl term i get os2 i might need scsi control rather ide . 
will perform suffer much ? 
for 200mb drive ? 
if i n't tape drive cd-rom ? 
ani help would appreci . 
so ve got multi-task want increas perform increas amount overlap . 
one way dma bus master . 
either make possibl io devic move data memori without interrupt cpu . 
the altern cpu move data . 
there sever scsi interfac card allow dma bus master . 
how bus-mast isa bus ? 
ide howev defin standard at interfac creat ibm pc at requir cpu move data byte dma . 
if re talk isa at bus 1 dma channel activ one time presum transfer data singl devic . 
so even though least 7 devic scsi bus explain 7 devic dma transfer singl scsi card isa-at bus time . 
think ! 
it 's scsi card dma transfer not disk ... 
the scsi card dma transfer contain data scsi devic attach want . 
an import featur scsi abil detach devic . 
this free scsi bus devic . 
this typic use multi-task os start transfer sever devic . 
while devic seek data bus free command data transfer . 
when devic readi transfer data aquir bus send data . 
on ide bus start transfer bus busi disk seek data transfer . 
this typic 10-20ms second lock process want bus irrespect transfer time . 
also i 'm still tri track copi ibm 's at refer book pc technic manual page 2-93 the fdd adapt buffer i.o bus use system board direct memori access dma record data transfer i expect see someth similar pc-at hdd adapt . 
so lowli low-dens origin pc fdd card use dma pc-at hdd control n't ! ? ! ? 
that make real sens .
