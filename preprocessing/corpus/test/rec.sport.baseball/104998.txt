actual i think large-scal sampl size part problem . 
it seem plot player basebal regard ba vs . 
clutch ba deviat would get kind bell curv . 
the x-axi deviat clutch hit vs . 
non-clutch y-axi number player . 
certain would player extrem end bell . 
my supposit find same player consist year year one end bell might abl make reason conclus player oppos basebal player . 
let 's care . 
if player ' perform complet random clutch-no clutch would still expect player good clutch everi year not-so-good everi year . 
with two year worth data 'd 14 player good year 14 bad year 12 would one good one bad year . 
we 96 player 5 year 84-'88 . 
just flip coin 'd expect 3 player good 5 year 3 bad everi year . 
this actual get no . 
good year 0 1 2 3 4 5 clutch perform 4 10 37 24 18 3 coin flip random 3 15 30 30 15 3 essenti distribut clutch perform number year good perform would get process lead deviat non-clutch perform complet random . 
if anyth clutch hit least definit predict capabl expect see number player end much larger predict flip coin . 
further limit player lot averag clutch situat say 1 standard deviat mean one year random explan still look good . 
in four year 84-'87 i look data elia 79 29 player minimum 25 50 bat clutch situat 1 sigma mean two differ year . 
of 79 29 player 38 14 chang sign two year . 
in word great clutch hitter one year realli horribl year . 
if random process 'd expect number 39.5 14.5 . 
everyth 's measur clutch hit period year could use predict abil propos definit look like random process caveat may someth relat platoon advantag could drag datae.g . 
john lowenstein probabl never clutch ab left-hand pitcher might well blowout would bias sinc clutch ab would gear platoon advantag . 
this subject glanc casual . 
a lot peopl put lot effort studi everi one except elia studi unabl find anyth would allow predict someon clutch situat better flip coin . 
self-serv plug follow flaw elia studi discuss paper forth- come sabr book the perfect game taylor publish .
