the no-balk seem give pitcher advantag . 
the base-walk allow runner challeng pitcher throw base . 
it may also increas number wild throw bag sinc pitcher know n't mani chanc pick runner may hurri much . 
i 'd rather see run score result sound hit sound basebal strategi rather sloppi could result kind rule .
