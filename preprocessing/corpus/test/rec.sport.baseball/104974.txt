i n't pretend understand statist analysi . 
well agre last part.- cool . 
and thank intellig respons devoid silli name-cal other . 
one basic thing need statist abl predict player 's perform futur correl year year . 
a player 's bat averag correl fair well year year . 
ok . 
basic problem someth like clutch bat averag overal bat averag correl year year almost zero . 
ad sampl size n't seem help much . 
actual i think large-scal sampl size part problem . 
it seem plot player basebal regard ba vs . 
clutch ba deviat would get kind bell curv . 
the x-axi deviat clutch hit vs . 
non-clutch y-axi number player . 
certain would player extrem end bell . 
my supposit find same player consist year year one end bell might abl make reason conclus player oppos basebal player . 
as counterexampl show consid follow two player 1984-1987 non-clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 if two player 1988 logic clutch situat 'd bat maldonado lemon blink eye . 
well 1988 maldonado hit .267 non-clutch .190 clutch lemon hit .254 non-clutch .313 clutch . 
befor accus complet cook data you wo n't hear kind accus . 
it interest select maldonado someon i also look . 
he inconsist hitter term ba hit 1989 92 .217 .273 .250 .272 admit trade leagu well club . 
his clutch hit record equal inconsist . 
so purpos 1993 i would draw conclus abil hit clutch base prior perform . 
i n't know i would felt 1988 may inde right . 
when i look sabo i found consist record hit consist pattern clutch hit proportion non-clutch ba . 
ditto joe carter . 
this probabl bring us heart disagr i other topic . 
must conclus base statist histori abl appli broad throughout data base valid ? 
is imposs irrat appli statist analysi select compon data base ? 
btw correl player ' overal bat averag 84-'87 88 give correl coeffici 0.59 signific someth better 99.9 confid level . 
correl clutch-non-clutch ba period give correl 0.088 signific level interest . 
i complet accept reason . 
again find individu end spectrum consist basi ? 
actual 's technic incorrect say ca n't predict futur clutch perform . 
it 's correct say ca n't predict futur clutch perform skill . 
amen .
