is judgement call part scorer sac fli rbi 's ? 
this situat brought question the red sox bottom 9th score 5-1 . 
the marin base load 1 . 
the batter hit fli center fielder catch . 
the runner third tag score without throw . 
now without judgement call i n't think one rbi batter . 
it seem better name would defens indiffer sinc n't realli matter whether guy third score point . 
i know i think sever if marin stole third second open base would allow batter hit grounder third baseman get deep hole third would n't play home third second mayb therefor ca n't make throw first get last etc ... 
scenario . 
but realli matter guy score way re 4 ? 
if tie run go score guy third . 
the point batter imo n't get credit rbi utter fail job point get hit walk trade one run . 
what guy think ?
