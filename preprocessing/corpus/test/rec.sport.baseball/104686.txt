1 would owner decreas ticket price obvious get lot peopl pay price re ask ? 
i n't think obvious lot peopl will pay price . 
i 'm sure someon net-land fact trend attend regard percentag capac sold . 
but even trend relat flat consid happen team-by-team basi . 
when tv money dri franchis seek supplant lost revenu altern sourc . 
one best sourc may ticket sale . 
exampl 1 the dodger the dodger count strong base season ticket sale probabl believ abil rais price without hinder revenu . 
i certain think true . 
exampl 2 the padr they lucki averag 10000 fan game year . 
if rais price less . 
if want increas overal revenu base best thing put win team field . 
but given wo n't happen wo n't probabl make money lower ticket price run frequent promot . 
will ? 
i idea . 
but wo n't increas price wo n't work . 
2 even assum strang power make owner decreas ticket price decreas tv contract . 
the strang power work forc market place . 
each team 's market somewhat differ owner go face uniqu set circumst deal market forc . 
as buiness manag i would never want lower price sometim strategi necessari sometim work . 
you consid everyth want continu success .
