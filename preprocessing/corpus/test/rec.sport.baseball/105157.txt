era indic averag number earn run attribut pitcher per nine inning game . 
thus pitcher pitch 3 inning gave 1 earn run 9 inning equivel perfom would 3 earn run thus era 3.00 . 
to comput era simpli take number earn run divid inning pitch multipl result 9 . 
era erip 9 i think anoth formula era . 
i heard someth last year .

if error occur repres third run error not count earn run . 
if pitcher issu base ball walk leav game inning complet respons peopl left base . 
if runner left base score score result error eran run attribut pitcher left game .
