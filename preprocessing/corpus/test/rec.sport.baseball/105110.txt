gant reason argu horribl call hirschbeck correct noth . 
gant proceed walk halfway 3rd base lean bat glare hirschbeck . 
while i n't necessasarili subscrib theori show peopl obvious attempt gant hirschbeck . 
he left hirschbeck choic take control situat . 
the bottom line gant start danger power struggl hirschbeck team need lost . 
the event i saw 1 call strike hirschbeck was look like hirschbeck point 3b umpir call strike ? 
i thought 's gant ask appeal 1st base umpir thought hirschbeck gotten checked-sw help wrong umpir .

after hirschbeck call pitch pitch thrown cox came onto field . 
it obvious tri get time call pitch one watch . 
9 pitch call strike . 
10 cox argu could n't see came field 11 cox eject player everywher 12 play final resum . 
gant n't ignor hirschbeck . 
not return made strike call fair like . 
although i suspect argument might gotten gant toss altogeth . 
but hirschbeck let gant step whole incid probabl would avoid .
