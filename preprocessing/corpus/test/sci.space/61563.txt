you may want put hubbl back payload bay reboost n't want clip panel time . 
the artist render i ve seen hst reboost still array fulli extend cradl hold hst 30 degre angl shuttl . 
i think render conceiv array replacemnet approv i 'm sure current reboost occur array deploy . 
howev n't appear array retract necessari reboost . 
for gamma-ray observatori one design requir stored-energi mecahn spring explos squib gas shock etc . 
use deploy . 
this partial everyth could reel back put back payload bay partial safeti consider . 
i ve heard wing cruis missil would cut half stand swath open . 
thank input gro 's sa design constraint . 
that would explain similar design uar . 
back shuttl would go everi day cost orbit 3.95 per pound everybodi design thing easi servic . 
heck mms project use design mission servic mind . 
the xte spacecraft origin design on-orbit replac instrument modul euv . 
that way get two instrument price one spacecraft bus explor platform . 
a second on-orbit replac also consid fuse telescop .
