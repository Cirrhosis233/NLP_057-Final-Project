put asid applic space dock factor consid pressur volum . 
temperatur control difficult space inflat hangar incorpor thermal insul mayb double-wal inflat . 
micrometeoroid protect radiat protect also requir . 
do n't think clear plastic bubbl 's like look like big white ball made kind multi-lay fabric soft-torso space suit made today . 
becaus almost man space vessel skylab mir salyut use pressur increas structur rigid even though metal skin still kind qualifi inflat . 
the inflat process would care control . 
the space environ reduc ductil expos materi due temperatur extrem monotom oxygen imping radiat effect materi fabric may retain flexibl long . 
this may matter . 
even inflat pressur chang hangar may caus flex fabric could lead hole tear ductil decreas .
