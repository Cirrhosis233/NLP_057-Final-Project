no thing design retriev pinch . 
inde dictat rather odd design solar array sinc retract well extend ... 
whi design solar array detach . 
shuttl go retunr hst bother array ... 
they detach emerg . 
but expens hardwar thrown away casual bear mind nobodi knew design defect . 
if deploy crew found nasti flaw lid fail open exampl would bit embarrass throw solar array away get thing back payload bay . 
i guess 's kind aesthet argument . 
i see solar array expens could conting would throw away brand new solar cell seem cheap compar toa shuttl mission would n't think would bother .
