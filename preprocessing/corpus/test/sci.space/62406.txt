lack skeleton mean muscl activ resist graviti time land rather suppli balanc forc . 
that mean much energi would requir creatur function . 
the bone also suppli leverag point push later movement . 
that 's n't find larg activ boneless creatur land . 
hydraul make rigid tube . 
no energi requir support . 
hydraul also allow creatur produc larg forc weak muscl use principl hydraul jack rather lever . 
this one yes thing . 
it 's true hydraul pressur tube somewhat rigid unpressur tube even 2000 psi level hydraul hose bend rather easili though 's straight-on compress strength high 's torsion resist increas practic nil . 
on grasp member 's doubt hydraul leverag exist natur . 
tree root exampl . 
given time shatter concret osmot pressur increas . 
it 's interest note land creatur either two leg 4 leg tini insect 6 8 leg never 3 leg though would stabl configur . 
it argu 2 leg creatur kangaroo 3-leg . 
the specif number limb creatur accid evolut hard make chang structur . 
the panda thumb plus mani finger ancestor five ? 
hand thumb modifi wristbon rather modifi finger extra finger much common extra limb especi fully-funct one . 
kangaroo 3-limb ? 
i n't think . 
if take view tail limb monkey kangaroo 5-limb . 
i think tail differ kind structur grossli enlarg case kangaroo primarili still instrument balanc rather locomot . 
i n't know much panda thumb i ll ask oppos ? 
thermodynam consider surfacevolum relationship would seem dictat activ complex creatur stay size rang similar see us . 
6 inch tall intellig alien seem unlik much larger eleph . 
whi ca n't lemur brontosaurus intellig ? 
yes i know brontosaurus mythic beast produc put head anoth dinosaur apatosaurus far space alien also mythic . 
well i wo n't say flat ca n't intellig i ll bring coupl line argument bear tri show i n't think 's like . 
first let say i say intellig i mean complex behavior respons novel situat level greater human tool use tool build . 
ie assum suitabl manipul present creatur allow alter 's enviro plan way . 
that 's certain univers complet definit intellig suffic putat technolog alien . 
now one know exact make brain capabl thought 's general accept one criteria certain level complex . 
this general determin number neuron cell interconnect . 
so creatur size lemur would n't enough neuron support complex thought . 
this argument consider less clear case dinosaur . 
there 's room larg brain though indic one ever develop . 
one reason may true neuron speed . 
the electrochem messag trigger neuron requir time propag . 
this make difficult high complex central brain coordin movement larg creatur . 
so 's littl select pressur brain . 
instead simpler distribut network evolv . 
this n't rule intellig dinosaur point direct . 
then thermodynam argument . 
a tini creatur like lemur need eat frequent 's intern heat rapid lost due 's high surfac volum ratio . 
i contend creatur must spend 's time energi feed wo n't time develop exercis intellig . 
that argument may somewhat weak . 
the dinosaur 's problem revers must moder 's heat product 's high volum surfac ratio make tend retain wast heat . 
i 'm assum certain temperatur rang optim chemic reactiv reason product neuron function . 
so creatur would tend need maintain regul temperatur rang near human carbon base . 
that tend rule cold blood creatur potenti home intellig . 
some peopl contend dinosaur may warm blood . 
but creatur size brontosaur 's activ level would restrain would prone generat intern steam explos wast heat . 
whale similar size reject heat ocean much effici sink air . 
i suspect intellig manifest certain degre activ interact environ necessari . 
ie monkey curious . 
i doubt larg dinosaur would capabl much activ .
