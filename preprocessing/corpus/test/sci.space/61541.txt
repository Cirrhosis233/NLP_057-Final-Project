how much energi burster put ? 
i know energi depend distanc unknown . 
an answer form x erg per megaparsec2 ok . 
differ sphere r.25pcoort cloud radius r22.5pcat edg galaxi r183.5pc edg galact corona last r8800mpc . 
for radius .25 pc found l around 1032 ergsec . 
pretti energet close . 
coron model found around 1043 ergsec . 
and last cosmolog model l1053 . 
that 's 'd call moder energet i 'd say . 
ani suggest could put much energi one second ? 
-jeremi supernova put 1053 1054 forget 's order magnitud .... 
not gamma ray though . 
you 'd hafta get gamma 9 mpc decent fraction sn output gamma could reason extragalact closer 9 mpc . 
i dunno sn theori well i ca n't think get mani gamma . 
mayb i look . 
big radio galaxi put 1046 erg continu . 
that 's radio ... 
lot gamma around burst ? 
nah . 
neither taken explan ... 
tri show energi produc thing know .
