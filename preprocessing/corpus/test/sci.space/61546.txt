get wierd ? 
okay launch one probe multipl part .. 
kind liek old mirv principl old cold war day . 
basic i mean design mother ship piggi back probe differ missionsnam differ planet . 
each probe would tie mother ship earth case may .. 
this good go mar mar mission act either mother ship relay point probe . 
i ca n't see need singl big ? 
expens ? 
heavi ? 
mothership except voyag style flybi mission . 
a year ago i calcul grand tour space probe launch saturn v 1975-76 . 
at timei felt idea big mother ship merit voyag rather small lightweight craft due limit impos use weak titan iiicentaur launcher . 
the concept i examin michael 's ? 
lot common british interplanetari societi 's daedalus project send probe barnard 's star i.e . 
larg bus spacecraft carri sever smaller probe dispatch ship arriv destin . 
the saturn v suppos would abl launch 10-ton payload toward jupit beyond . 
the bus could includ far power camerastelescopesscientif equip heaviermor power power sourc voyag would limit weight anymor . 
extrem import voyag perform measur within coupl week planetari encount usual relat great distanc . 
the smaller probe carri aboard might base real voyag even smaller version like one schedul launch toward pluto earli 21st centuri would releas various point mission . 
the advantag obvious bus would carri basic jupiter-saturn-uranus-neptun mission voyag 2 addit two sub-prob could relas saturn examin planet 's south polar region move pluto . 
this would enabl nasa map hemispher plutocharon 1986 ... sever probe could examin part jupitersaturnuranusneptun system n't examin great detail voyag due trajectory-rel factor . 
a small swarm camera-equip miniatur space probe releas month encount would cost small voyager-typ mission entir feasibl launch heavi well-equip spacecraft . 
and would learn lot outer planet ! 
the reason grand tour cancel lack money cours .
