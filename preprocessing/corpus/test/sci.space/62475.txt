doubtful credibl astronom . 
modern ground-bas visibl light astronomi propos orbit billboard would upset alreadi die field the ahh perhap 's ve astronom built 2 10-meter ground-bas scope studi design larger one . 
fc exact fraction current research done big fc visabl light telescop ? 
from i ve seen 10 less fc amlost 100 25 year ago . 
that sound like die fc ... 
that n't seem like fair comparison . 
infrar astronomi n't realli get start someth like 25 yrs . 
ago n't explod ira 1983 . 
gamma-ray i think x-ray observ n't realli get start 70s . 
i believ true ultraviolet observ general i know extrem uv short 1000 angstrom observ euv launch last year almost histori except observ skylab 70s . 
twenty-f year ago vast major astronom access optic radio instrument . 
now far instrument avail growth new field result optic work repres smaller fraction total astronom work . 
serious though re never go get 10-meter scope orbit cheapli build one ground adapt optic good site differ qualiti narrow quit bit anyway . 
fc that would true adapt optic work well visabl . 
fc but take look paper subject they refer anyth fc 100 micron visabl . 
i n't know fc peopl troubl see beyond 7 micron ... 
there fc reason think adapt optic work shorter fc wavelength without trueli radic improv technolog . 
hmm folk depart plan use adapt optic 5 palomar near-infrar observ 1 2 micron might surpris hear . 
and n't ntt alreadi push toward 0.1 arcsecond resolut ground-bas site rememb 0.1 arcsecond one sell point hst .
