no thing design retriev pinch . 
inde dictat rather odd design solar array sinc retract well extend may thus indirect contribut array-flap problem . 
whi design solar array detach . 
shuttl go retunr hst bother array . 
fit quick releas . 
i n't think bi-stem design use much retriev abil launch tight size sts envelop . 
this guess base similar design flown larg sts-launch sc gro uar . 
also might consider given mass requir bi-stem weight less convent sa . 
final hst array abil detachedrememb re go replac new array . 
howev ac guy 's seen branch manag pull collect hair hst i would voic hearti yea ' use convent array bi-stem whenev possibl . 
no half hertz flexibl mode thermal snap problem .
