i bought new portabl cd player offic i notic proud proclaim 8 time oversampl box . 
now i think i understand oversampl rate discret sampl exceed highest frequenc compon interest factor i n't understand 8 time busi ... 
it seem i bought first cd player realli 10 year ago ? ! 
spec said 4 time ... 
could someon pleas tell whether i 'm get senil ? 
if i 'm good player take sampl higher rate ? 
the data ever read bar mistrack cours eventu get turn 44.1 khz 16 bit two channel data . 
oversampl take two discret data point interpol n-1 point n time oversampl . 
when i ask peopl said interpol simpli linear interpol signific complic . 
you quit correct understand . 
the filter interpol would distort frequenc content signal listen . 
general player run sampl thru all-pass filter network . 
i done ecg waveform person 's heart effect rather spooki . 
it actual reconstruct peak n't correct ! 
fill gap proper comput valu real sampl taken point . 
i use cpu math . 
it take decent unreason amount cpu time . 
you keep thing realtim write effici code . 
in case care filter method use fir finit impuls respons filter . 
i 'd guess cd maker use kind method . 
anybodi know real answer ? 
i 'd say use tap delay line resistorop-amp weight accomplish filter . 
this strike cost effect method volum product run . 
anyway purpos oversampl move effect sampl rate n time 44.1 khz order use higher frequenc antialias filter . 
for qualiti filter higher oversampl let build cheaper filter wherea price filter higher oversampl let build better filter . 
so assum qualiti compon cd player remain oversampl allow manufactur produc slight better sound due anti-alia filter . 
actual i think reason say market gimic . 
i would guess acut cheaper filter oversampl signal . 
you use sloppier compon give filter roll-off n't sharp . 
it 's bad charg someth i think actual less cost build . 
i serious doubt filter cost better . 
they built price spec spec say cheap possibl ! .
