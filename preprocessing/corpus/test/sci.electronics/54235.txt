this good idea .. 
i upgrad motherboard last fall . 
i would quit piss softwar would forc reinstal simpli i chang motherboard . 
opinion understand . 
i assum tape drive ? 
not us 200 floppi around backup know . 
actual i n't tape drive . 
in event total hard disk failur i reinstal app origin restor data backup i keep . 
with upward 100mb stuff hard disk way i 'm go tri back without tape drive . 
would nice one though ! 
ram someth add time . 
it 's like bio manufactur andor processor type 386486etc . 
data use esp new flash rom bio machin updat diskett . 
mayb mayb . 
today n't happen often i would hope bio buggi user get upgrad bio inform go chang least date anyway . 
tag bio manufactur still go fals tag user upgrad motherboard . 
this type upgrad n't requir hard disk backuprestor . 
on hand make less intrus could disguis pleas insert origin disk xx i need file yyyyyi updat . 
it would perfect reason ... 
sort . 
as long n't done terribl often . 
otherwis i think would get annoy user would go look softwar . 
this silli . 
it 's much easier loan disk friend let instal backup copi alreadi disk give . 
your scheme n't go stop anyon . 
of cours easier . 
are say origin should allow one instal ? 
what point ? 
of cours . 
if someth get corrupt app need reinstal worst thing i want softwar tell softwar alreadi regist blank law instal machin or someth similar access window requir click ok go away . 
pretti non-intrus get point across . 
what i said program certain restrict restrict-to-one-machin until program regist manufactur . 
the manufactur suppli then-proven-legitimate-us patch disabl restrict proud proclaim legal copi regist xxx screen . 
this great idea . 
i like key system sharewar product use . 
the problem difficult big softwar compani implement without get cost-ineffect burden benefit user .
