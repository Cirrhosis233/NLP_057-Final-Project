the atari 2600 use 6502 cpu like entir 8-bit line 400 80012001400 1440 130xe 65xe comput well 5200 game machin . 
wrong 6507 . 
sorri ian i n't toy sever year . 
i n't seen insid quit year . 
i saw post lag quit day thought i 'd toss 0.02 . 
i assum 6507 function similar 6502 also made mos technolog ? . 
i realli vers 6502 base atari comput . 
the 2600 came later . 
the 2600 extra asic chip basic modifi graphic chip pia 's joystick . 
it one custom chip asic sens word understood tia sometim known 6526 although manufactur list cia complex interfac adapt . 
tia stand televis interfac adapt handl sound paddl minim video hardwar 2600 possess . 
in atari comput cia chip refer sound aw lot like ctia color televis interfac adapt chip use earli model . 
later atari upgrad gtia graphic .... 
other color literatur state gtia might stood georg develop chip . 
there also standard 6532 ram io timer riot plus voltag regul memori serv 555 timer .

later model 2600 might incorpor mani chip one asci weight machin part count decreas lot year . 
not accord servic document i . 
the 2600 chang inten much . 
funni i old new model .

addit i think 2600 use 2k 4k 8k rom game . 
rom map upper 4k 6507 's address space . 
2k 4k game fine later 8k 16k game need bank switch . 
atari other made much huge cartridg .
