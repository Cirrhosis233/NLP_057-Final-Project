in order emit blue light semiconductor must band gap energi within region 2.6 2.8 electron volt . 
accord physic electron prof ca n't get led band gap . 
that 's n't find blue led matter colour led . 
that say blue led ca n't found . 
i ve seen blue ' led sold typic visibl light led blue plastic cover . 
they n't emit much light ... 
um ... 
1 your professor plain wrong . 
although blue led one heck lot less effici red one . 
2 typic visibl light led n't realli exist . 
led fair narrow region transmitt . 
sinc fermi energi around either side band gap fall exponenti blah blah ... 
sourc solid state electron devic ben g . 
streetman 3d ed . 
prentic hall you might want check copyright date . 
blue led certain exist i ve got bunch work . 
cree research make probabl along compani ... 
cree big materi scienc though advertis stuff like physic today etc .. 
you buy jameco i think digikey definit plenti distributor . 
actual day get typic visibl light led 's call rainbow led i ve forgotten make advertis edn mani trade rag though . 
it combin reg green blue led one chip four lead . 
nifti devic although 's probabl fair expens .
