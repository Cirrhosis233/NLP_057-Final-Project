i bit surpris manual fluke-87 multimet suggest appli wd-40 test lead socket especi current rang socket . 
the intent prevent test-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper go test lead socket . 
the manual bit vagu i think i 'd appli wd-40 swab wipe socket instead spay stuff direct . 
speak said meter i compar 87 8060a i ve bench almost 11 year . 
it five year sinc 8060a calibr . 
on dc scale agre within .01 mv . 
ac scale within .1 mv . 
the 87 would perfect portabl meter db scale i n't feel worth extra 100 second 8060 sinc i n't use db much work .
