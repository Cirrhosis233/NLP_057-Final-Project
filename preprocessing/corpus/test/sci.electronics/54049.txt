the 2600 chang inten much . 
addit i think 2600 use 2k 4k 8k rom game . 
rom map upper 4k 6507 's address space . 
2k 4k game fine later 8k 16k game need bank switch . 
atari other made much huge cartridg . 
i idea much ram work i would hazard guess 2 4k ram . 
wrong 128 byte ram riot . 
this multipli map page 0 pseudo-regist page 1 stack also throughout bottom 4k memori . 
tia regist also sat address space . 
as 128 byte ram somewhat limit later cartridg also carri ram interest atari provid write line cart . 
this manag map read ram one address rang write anoth time scheme ate scarc rom address space .
