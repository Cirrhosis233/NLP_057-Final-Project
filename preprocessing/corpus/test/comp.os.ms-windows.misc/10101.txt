i eisa machin i understand eisa video card match perform isa counterpart . 
for instanc eisa orchid pro design iis- fast isa diamond speedstar plus n't i would call fast i n't understand eisa video card n't group level perform local bus card given eisa video card 32 bit bus move data around instead isa 's 8 bit . 
good question . 
answer the eisa bus move 32 bit rather isa 's 816 ? 
but still move speed isa bus . 
i think 's either 8 10 mhz . 
the local bus design also move 32 bit like eisa move data cpu speed 40 mhz . 
so 33mhz cpu local bus move 32bit data 33 mhz eisa move 32bit data 8 10 mhz . 
so local bus 3 4 time faster eisa 33 mhz cpu . 
eisa two mayb 3 time fast isa . 
sinc would anyon includ pay higher cost eisa video card perform better often wors much cheaper isa video board diamond speedstar 24x ? 
from pc magazin 's i think recent report i know ati make pretti fast eisa video card 's around 500 doubl wallet allow spend . 
and 500 i could get diamond viper still 100 left cours i 'd get local bus mother- board ... 
that 's good question . 
the eisa bus advantag isa bus 's width . 
for exampl morebett interrupt bus master . 
but factor impact video card much . 
they impact file server multipl hard drive full-throttl network card cd-rom etc .
