back day x11.1 i analys xterm code . 
the cursor implement draw rectangl around charact . 
i n't seem chang til . 
but sourc could add blink cursor via xtappaddtimeout similar - . 
the server overhead mild ridicul though see also desqviewx dos window . 
do realli want xterm wake everi half second whack server bitblt ? 
so ? 
i 'm run emu 25 mhz 68020 box . 
i make ani differ perform whether cursor set blink if think bit cycl 400 ms hell lot time even slowest pc . 
sinc would cours enabl blink text cursor xterm input focus applic activ anyway . 
to repeat blink text cursor cost almost noth perform need thought design xterm softwar .
