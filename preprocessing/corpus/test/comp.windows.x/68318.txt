you stuck distribut system feedback loop ! 
what xtermin run xterm net anoth machin ? 
that load problem occur . 
if machin 20 xtermin attach blink cursor xterm 's could repres consider ethernet bandwidth wast . 
ethernet certain enough bandwidth blink cursor . 
my lisp machin blink cursor twice second updat time status line everi second . 
this use 1k bytessecond .1 bandwidth ethernet . 
a hundr singl ethernet might problem coupl dozen fine . 
bandwidth unlik problem except wet string network . 
one major flaw x horrend number transact henc process switch forc upon host . 
actual measur hour averag 5 per second per log user lead 20-50 process switch depend whether event filter window manag well applic mani process need charact . 
while blink cursor need applic network process add transact add someth like 10 process switch per second per user . 
this signific increas overhead especi applic may quit larg work set . 
if want rapid blink cursor could mani 50 . 
if want go i would n't start !
