i understood two method connect applic code widget callback action the problem i face i quit long piec applic code perform lot draw window . 
i want connect widget . 
no problem far . 
i could use callback function action process event afterward . 
but draw take i want applic code sequenc abl interrupt event . 
then i want handl event resum process applic code point interrupt . 
it seem n't possibl i give user impress input immedi process use workproc . 
see xtappaddworkproc3xt . 
you split draw routni small chunk hard part . 
then callback start draw call xtappaddworkproc call workproc first time . 
your workproc function return boolean ... 
true finish fals want keep process . 
if return fals workproc automat re-instal . 
note method better use time-out loop sinc event get process precedence-ori manner . 
if use ada bind i howev hose look xtappaddtimeout3xt .
