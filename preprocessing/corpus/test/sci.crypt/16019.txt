second question whi ! ? ! ? 
whi strang procedur use real rng this turn s1s2 kind bottleneck system- secur . 
the theori make sens s1 s2 either chip vari among possibl anyon tri break encrypt brute forc need plow possibl serial number 230 one billion multipli number differ s1 s2 combin . 
suppos instead s1 s2 reconstruct given 3 4 unit key generat singl batch sort known plaintext attack say . 
suppos 3 4 chip program session never find way commerci product instead end elsewher . 
suppos folk elsewher determin unit key given physic access one chip . 
then folk determin s1 s2 whole batch ... 
too mani supposit ? 
yeah probabl .
