the serial number 64 bit block 34 bit filler . 
doe n't take lot check see correct . 
depend whether filler constant make check easi suscept replay variabl e.g . 
timer counter random make replay harder also make easier inquisitor know ve miss messag gotten sequenc interest thing sort person might care . 
i 'd use secret nope obscur cryptograph encod expand 30 bit serial number 64 bit block . 
the redund herebi introduc use detect tamper clipper signal public enemi replac l.e . 
block random data . 
and cours l.e . 
block would use initialis encrypt user data receiv end correct l.e . 
block must process order chanc get plaintext back . 
for might want mangl l.e . 
block e.g . 
xor- constant pattern transmiss line restor feed receiv crippler chip i would add encrypt copi block perhap creat repeat applic encrypt algorithm regular interv transmiss . 
if receiv chip detect mismatch must assum line bad ceas work interest protect get faulti plaintext know 's like checksum safeti - . 
the monitor agenc ' wo n't famous black box need actual decrypt kept fbi noth prevent use special box redund check serial number block consist check embed l.e . 
block within transmiss . 
these box turn red light soon detect bitstream violat correct protocol . 
so n't anyon think use chip fool l.e . 
tap key i bet developp provid much better check suggest . 
of cours 's absolut crucial algorithm protocol remain secret . 
person i doubt .
