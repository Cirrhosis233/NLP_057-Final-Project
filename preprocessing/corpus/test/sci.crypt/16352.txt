you could well use 16 charact password perform encrypt 64 zero bit . 
one simpl method would use first 8 charact encrypt 64 zero bit use remain 8 charact encrypt result . 
the output would still 64 bit encod 11 ascii charact . 
would n't method vulner birthday attack ? 
current cracker need find 1 key produc given ciphertext . 
he tri 263 key averag . 
in propos method cracker need pair key halv . 
if store 232 guess one half like find mathch pair 232 guess . 
here i assum des-encrypt revers key guess . 
is modif s-box salt bit make non-revers ?
