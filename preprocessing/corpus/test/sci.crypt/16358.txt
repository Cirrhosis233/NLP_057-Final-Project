i think coupl way guarante authent one-tim pad encrytp scheme though i 'm sure prove kind authen provid . 
an obvious first-attempt might prepend truli random unpredict eve block messag calcul crc includ random start block messag . 
this could encrypt messag . 
the problem i 'm sure 's imposs come messag hash crc regardless random start block . 
it intuit seem like ought hard i 'm sure .... 
clear crypto-strength hash like md5 sha would stronger i 'm sure i 'm comfort claim 's unbreak . 
a scheme use pad bit decid mani bit 0 's includ plaintext stream go would n't bad either . 
at cost increas speed use pad could use give arbitrarili low probabl oppon could spoof valid-look messag sinc deciph plaintext spot carri 0 's show someth funni 's go . 
if messag bit mi use one random bit ri decid whether insert 0 plaintext stream 'd get total pad use 2.5 time messag length . 
we 'd expand messag size half . 
each 0 appear plaintext stream n't guess would-b spoofer . 
at bit guess . 
i 'm tri see quantifi chanc make way spoof messag get littl complic get un- synch still happen 0 place spoof messag . 
now i see simpl way 's got secur one-tim pad cost use 4 time messag length pad bit . 
for messag bit mi use one random bit ri xor togeth get xi . 
now encrypt three bit one-tim pad . 
the enemi way guess ri hesh ca n't guess xi either . 
ani chang make ciphertext stream involv guess ri . 
is way without use mani pad bit ? 
spoof messag equival correct guess mani random bit bit messag . 
clear make spoof messag hard know whole messag text know none . 
in fact look like make hard generat spoof messag ciphertext without i 'm entir sure . 
is easier way 's provabl secur one-tim pad ?
