serious though i wonder someon cph would end get biopsi first place ? 
my understand feel free correct enzym worst mild elev overal normal hepat function . 
i would think clue might histori prior hepb infect posit hepb-sag . 
or inde continuum cah distinct mere one patholog prognosi otherwis ident clinic featur ? 
chronic persist hepat usual diagnos someon liver biopsi patient persist elev serum transaminas month bout acut viral hepat someon found persist elev transaminas routin screen test . 
the degre elev serum transaminas trivial much ten time normal . 
other blood chemistri usual normal . 
as rule patient cph clinic sign liver diseas . 
chronic activ hepat also asymptomat minim symptomat least initi 's 's import tell apart mean biopsi . 
the patient cph need reassur . 
the patient cah need treat .
