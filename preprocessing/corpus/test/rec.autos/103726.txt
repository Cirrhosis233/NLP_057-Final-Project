i n't think transmiss fluid chang solv problem . 
unless extrem cold climat use heavi weight fluid . 
follow manufactur 's recommend oil weight . 
some car i standard transmiss 4 5 speed recommend chang transmiss fluid 30000 mile normal drive condit . 
i ve gone 100000 without chang transmiss oil replac transmiss bear ! . 
my older car use 85 weight oil wherea 92 honda use 10-30 motor oil mayb 30 weight .
