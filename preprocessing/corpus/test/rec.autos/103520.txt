the solid axl theoret stronger the new cruiser do not independ suspens front . 
they still run straight axl coil . 
the 4runner one independ front . 
the cruiser incred wheel travel system . 
reliabl newer model experi tell . 
the independ front suspens doubt compromis made satisfi typic user never need real util vehicl . 
the second differ type transfer case use newer model . 
i 'm sure i think tioyota went full-tim 4wd all-wheel drive system . 
the older landcruis lock-up type . 
both advantag disadvantag . 
the 91-up cruiser full time 4wd center diff lock low rang . 
my brother 91 incred sturdi vehicl done 4 trail moab without tow . 
the 93 later even better bigger engin lock diff .
