could someon explain make sens drag coeffici i.e cd mention magazin . 
i understand lower number signifi better aerodynam mean real world . 
is way calcul new top speedsassum car rev limit top speed mileag benefit ident car cd reduc .34 .33 . 
i n't rememb formula 's hand awhil sinc i took aerodynam n't use stuff sinc . 
the cd relat drag forc effect top speed fuel consumpt . 
when drag forc car aircraft greater vehicl 's engin overcom reach top speed . 
auto cours also overcom roll resist sinc drag oppos vehicl 's motion engin must make burn fuel . 
anyway sinc geometeri auto rather complex dragpressur coeffiecentetc either found experimentali use numer method . 
anyway flow around cylind drag coeff cd dq2r drag forc q flow veloc r radius clyinder . 
to get rough rough estim set r 12 car 's width q car 's speed know cd find drag forc car would need overcom .
