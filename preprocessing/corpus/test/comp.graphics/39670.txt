i 'd like know system cpu hd array framebuff play record hdtv qualiti move pictur realtim . 
hdtv 6mbframe recordingplay move pictur need 180mbsec bandwidth . 
i 'm think treat raw data .. 
compress . 
actual digit hdtv system 's far higher bandwidth need unless 's reason must work fully-uncompress hdtv . 
also calcul frame well 6mb even use 24 bitspixel bit actual need 15 18 enough move pictur . 
1600x1100x16bit 3.5mb i 'm guess hdtv resolut may bit wider 1600 i 'm fair sure 1100 number digit propos . 
i hope fast memori system well 180mbs display requir heavili interleav vram system . 
unless compel reason i 'd advis tri use least somewhat compress data . 
you n't go full compress get level data io requir much cheaper easier deal . 
gnu emac lisp oper system disguis word processor .
