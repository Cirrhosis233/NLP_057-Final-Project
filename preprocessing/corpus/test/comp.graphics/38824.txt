i recent talk possibl employ mine ! 
made refer 48-bit graphic computerimag process system . 
i seem rememb call imag someth akin . 
anyway claim 48-bit color 12-bit alpha channel . 
that 's 60 bit infowhat could possibl ? 
specif 48-bit color ? 
that 's 280 trillion color mani human eye resolv . 
is anti-alias thing ? 
or magic number make work better certain processor . 
well 48 bit colour could improv resolut 16 bit per channel seem like bit excess . 
i seen paper quot 10 bit per channel 12 bit comput precis . 
more would seem wast . 
perhap frame buffer use anoth colourspac need bit repres full rang rgb cube compact encod . 
most like howev two separ 24 bit 8 bit per compon frame buffer . 
this set call doubl buffer allow complex 3d pictur built one buffer buffer contain previous frame display . 
this make smoother anim . 
sad i access none . 
just dec 500025 . 
sigh . 
well hey want brag number 5000 rang take pxg turbo card 96 bit per pixel . 
full doubl buffer two 24 bit buffer 24 bit z buffer extra 24 bit buffer screen imag storag . 
mind card cost workstat .
