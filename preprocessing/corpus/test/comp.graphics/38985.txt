anyon think tiff complex n't dealt cgm asn.1 cda dca sgml one number success file format . 
peopl seem perfect capabl deal other . 
well yeah unlik tiff substanti encod rectangular bitmap . 
and other hard troubl free . 
i hear quit common cgm implement interoper . 
the annoy thing tiff along 50 use option 100 stupid option . 
the egregi exampl rather pick byte order bit order use consist tiff file byte bit order option tiff reader machin matter natur byte order prepar byte swap . 
there four slight differ fax format one would adequ . 
rgb imag store pixel compon complex without function etc etc . 
i also note tiff doc say aldus ' experi show lzw reliabl compress well better fax format suggest none fax format realli use . 
what 's wors lot format n't even implement well e.g . 
lzw limit code word 12 bit 14 16 bit would provid substanti better compress . 
and lzw method compress byte rather pixel . 
but absolut worst thing tiff vendor regist proprietari tiff code format without even public document . 
this mean no way write tiff reader reliabl read incom tiff file . 
some standard .
