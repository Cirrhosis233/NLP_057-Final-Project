luci wilson access servic librarian colleg engin univers cincinnati yup . 
most jpeg viewer seem requir specif video driver sinc support specif video card . 
some standard ibm bio video support vga 320x200 256 colour mode leav card hercul monochrom card way give good pictur qualiti dither work right . 
i ca n't rememb name jpeg viewer sinc i usual convert jpeg 's gif 's view . 
but requir vesa driver video card . 
you n't need special hardwar view jpeg 's except perhap vga card mayb 286 processor . 
most peopl day program 286 comput neglect rest 86 processor 8086 8088 . 
i 8088 clone nec v20 processor hercul card i write program view gif 's anim vga colour graphic board monochrom hercul card . 
i use floyd-steinberg dither found one someth neat colour palett result dither imag give much greater detail normal would view monochrom system . 
compushow 8.50 fs dither standard thing imag palett dither way give brighter detail imag . 
anyway enough rambl wrong direct .
