when incid ray i strike object point p ... 
the reflect ray r transmit ray t calcul formula . 
call routin recurs r t return colour along ray r t rcol tcol . 
each object colour ocol light sourc licol 1 n . 
the question how combin rcol tcol ocol licol 's get correct result colour return along i ray ? 
first not snide respons re confus issu stumbl lot thing well . 
i suggest weak refer materi . 
get an introduct ray trace andrew glassner good coverag raytrac algorithm . 
you could also refer 2nd edit foley van dam . 
on question . 
the simpl answer keep ad contribut clamp maximum intens . 
for exampl intens valu rang 0.0 1.0 keep ad clamp result valu 1.0 might clamp lower bound 0.0 dark bulb 's anoth issu so get illumin equat like i lambient ldiffuselightn lreflect ltranspar the contribut due reflect sum light intens light due transpar . 
now slight less hand-wav illumin equat i kala kdldlightn krlr ktlt that compon illumin equat govern materi constant ka kd kr kt . 
so maximum get transpar given object exampl might 0.4 0.1 0.5 purple-color glass object . 
hope answer question . 
i ll forward illumin equat sermon also .
