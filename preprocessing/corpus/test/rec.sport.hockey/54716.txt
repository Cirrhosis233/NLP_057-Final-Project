in last night game toronto receiv five penalti detroit none . 
if which game watch ? 
did n't see third period wing 2 penalti call delay penalti ? 
the leaf 2 man advantag minut 1 man advantag anoth minut two leaf still could n't score . 
and i wonder leaf score powerplay goal accord never powerplay . 
in detroit paper today said 40 penalti call last night 's game . 
and re say detroit none penalti ? 
i 'm guess watch first period . 
i admitt leaf get alot penalti period wing n't get mani have n't look box score yet . 
but ref made third period . 
lauri marshal wayn state univers detroit michigan go wing ! ! !

as well point n't ref bias call lot penalti work benefit wing . 
have ref call whole bunch penalti one team call bunch make take lot away could great game .
