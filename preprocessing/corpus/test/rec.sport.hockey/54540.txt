as pick ottawa pick 1 mean almost 100 alexand daigl go 1 . 
he ll either stay trade montreal quebec . 
i dunno hat . 
i friend geni say ottawa 's gone soft daigl think hard pronger . 
daigl shown attitud latter part season mani folk havne't like come back second multi-gam suspens stupid 's realli tank perform . 
his stock drop like rock . 
also rememb lot teh draft 1st stuff come assumpt ll trade quebec lot prospect . 
it 's clear quebec would realli will pay lot given current status . 
he 's still first round i n't consid first pick lock mean point . 
it 's also possibl senat postur tri bring sign price sinc daigl take lindro lesson thos suspens . 
imo i would take kariya . 
he alot leadership ncaa far world championship . 
daigl n't show junior team . 
san jose get kariya . 
no . 
kariya wo n't go first three simpl reason 's leav colleg i n't believ ani expans team go use first someon wo n't around anoth year two equal good almost good stuff avail make immedi impact . 
san jose seem lean heavili toward niedermay reason . 
kariya could go 6th 7th unless team convinc leav school earli i doubt . 
my cut thing stand today draft order 1 ottawa 60 daigl 40 pronger 2 san jose 80 niedermay unless ottawa skip daigl . 
then 's open . 
depend shark get deal . 
i n't believ draft keep . 
3 tampa bay whoever ottawa n't take mayb koslov
