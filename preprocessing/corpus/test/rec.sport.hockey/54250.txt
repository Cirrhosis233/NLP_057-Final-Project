daigl n't show junior team . 
san jose get kariya . 
tampa bay either go russian kozlov i think 's defenseman rob niedemey probabl spelt last name wrong the shark appear lean toward pick rob niedermay center brother scott defenseman pick nj coupl year ago . 
they brought physicaltryout week ago . 
from i read niedermay best skater draft play both offens defens n't afraid physic play . 
defens shark look pretti good term defens prospect rathj sykora ragnarsson center kisio et al get old . 
with small player shark i just can't see pick yet anoth small player like kariya 'd get bash oppposit get separ shoulder .
