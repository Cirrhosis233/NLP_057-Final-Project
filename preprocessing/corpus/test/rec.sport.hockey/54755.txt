i 'd like echo sentiment . 
this worst coverag i ever rememb see cbc . 
as soon game end i count 30 time ve sign air . 
no post game interview updat late score nothin ' . 
tsn realli put cbc shame . 
i hope later round coverag improv i mean realli want see cbc primetim news instead hockey . 
my .02 darren this concess mansbridg cbc news argu re go play havoc schedul least make sure prime time air soon possibl . 
news got commit post-gam show would scrap network would go ptn within one minut game end . 
as earlier comment cbc ontariocentr frank doublehead decison goe way peopl west cant see leaf peopl central canada ca n't see jet game . 
the reason decis cbc 's feel could n't sell advertis six hour hockey one night . 
as want see news hockey lot peopl . 
cbc alway get plenti complaint juggl news schedul .
