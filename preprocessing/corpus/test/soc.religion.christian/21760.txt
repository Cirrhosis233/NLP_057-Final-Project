michael l . 
siemon i say you god son shall die like men fall there 's certain ambigu discuss posit whether re speak tradit paul 's time . 
i think two way use tradit . 
one say paul reader share tradit make sens interpret word context share tradit . 
that 's make think argument word turn silli . 
we know paul came background rather puritan sex . 
everyth els say sex consist background . 
the tone remark homosexu rom 1 consist background . 
even word sin list n't general term homosexu activ seem 's evid one piec evid someth would probabl will believ evid paul share common jewish reject homosexu . 
but identifi cathol posit 's rather hors differ color . 
the cathol posit involv continu church tradit . 
argument specif tradit might 1 get guidanc interpret paul 's origin mean tradit e.g . 
way church father interpret 2 gain confid prohibit still appli time univers judgement church time . 
i think somewhat differ use tradit . 
a radic protest might will use known 1st cent . 
tradit illumin paul 's origin mean use cathol posit answer question attitud homosexu .
