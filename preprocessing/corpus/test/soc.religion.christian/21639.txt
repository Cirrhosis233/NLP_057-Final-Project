in cours discuss sabbath folk i came across someth complet new i thought i 'd offer comment . 
to keep brief possibl let state observ declar statement whoever want comment . 
basic i think i ve observ phrase ten command use mose refer ex . 
201-17 rather refer ten distinct discours ex . 
201 ex . 
3118 . 
that phrase ten command accur translat ten discours passag call ten command realli first . 
i 'm complet convinc true purpos discuss let argu though i sure . 
argument support idea 1 there n't realli ten command ex . 
201-17 . 
in order get 10 command get two vers 3-6 vers support divis worship god . 
that vers 3 command god vers 5 command worship idol mention vers 4 . 
you ca n't violat vers 5-6 without violat vers 3 indic whole passag one command leav us nine command . 
i could go length i ll stop summari . 
2 there are ten speech ex 201 begin tradit ten command ex 3118 god actual give mose two tablet ten commandmentsdiscours written . 
i break ten follow 201-17 2022-26 211-2333 251-3010 3011-16 3017-21 3022-33 3034-38 311-11 3112-18 . 
in case passag begin variat phrase and lord spoke mose say .. 
the except ex . 
211 begin now ordin set .. 
3 the word translat command phrase ten command n't realli word command word speech utter . 
it 's word often use longer discours rather individu statement instanc combin word yom ' day word translat chronicl phrase rest act so-and-so written chronicl x ? .. 
the word command freeli use throughout book mose perhap signific mose spoke ten x 's appear avoid word command chosen instead word associ discours longer singl command . 
4 god tell mose he go give stone tablet law command ex 2412 yet he give mose tablet he finish ten discours mount sinai . 
if ten command ex . 
201-17 immedi clear god would wait sever day nine discours give tablet mose . 
on hand ten discours written tablet make perfect sens god would give mose tablet he finish deliv ten discours . 
5 when mose get tablet found tablet written side ex . 
3215 . 
if ten command first 17 vers ex . 
20 god would written larg letter ! 
not he could n't cours seem like refer two tablet contain ten discours written normal- size letter . 
6 in ii cor . 
3 paul seem specif singl command written stone ministri death fade away ministri condemn with possibl except command sabbath difficult see paul would refer command ex . 
201-17 temporari fade away-typ command . 
this less problem stone tablet happen includ command ex 20 ex 31 . 
argument idea the main argument idea asid fact contradict long-stand tradit dt 522 mose say quot command ex . 
201-17 these word lord spoke ... he ad . 
and he wrote two tablet stone gave this appear identifi word quot content two stone tablet . 
that first impress anyway . 
howev thought i note great deal hing understand phrase these word if mose meant these word i relat spoken god etc . 
would mean tradit ten command stone tablet . 
if howev mose make parenthet commentthes word i am now tell spoken god etc.then 's quit differ . 
i note dt 5 account mose tell given stone tablet befor tell peopl ask mose repres god wherea exodus account peopl ask mose first second discours sever day befor god gave mose stone tablet . 
this reinforc idea mose ' remark dt 522ff intend parenthet remark rather strict chronolog account god wrote point he stop ad tablet . 
summari thing consid i find somewhat like nine command ex 20 realli first mose regard ten discours god . 
i n't know anybodi ever espous idea 's brand-new . 
so i lean toward accept i would interest hear comment critic anyon may care offer .
