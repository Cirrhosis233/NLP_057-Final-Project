if babi suppos baptis n't bibl ever say . 
it never come right say onli peopl know right wrong taught baptis this sound argument baptis babi . 
it assum bibl n't say specif n't need someth must mean need . 
i know 's specif term form logic escap right . 
howev sound abl appli way if bibl n't specif say someth wrong must ok coincident lead perfect question i ve often ponder . 
this less logic assumpt someth bibl must done . 
but i n't realli think 's 's say anyway . 
see . 
if slaveri immor i believ i assum everyon els group ? 
n't jesus apostl speak ? 
own slave common practic back . 
paul speak everyth els immor . 
he appar thought import enough talk thing like drunkard . 
whi n't anyon mention slaveri ? 
if god 's moral etern n't chang like moral societi must immor today . 
what letter philemon ? 
in paul least hint certain slave releas . 
also slaveri time type slaveri u. . 
i think better comparison would indentur servitud . 
i n't realli want get discuss slaveri . 
anyway although demonstr point i n't think relev origin poster say absenc specif condemen prove someth immor . 
back origin poster 's assert . 
he fact make logic error accus . 
he state fact bibl say babi baptiz . 
also know bibl say everyon must baptiz enter heaven . 
everyon includ infant unless scriptur contrari i.e . 
except . 
sinc except list bibl must assum safe side bibl mean say everyon must baptiz enter heaven . 
and baptiz infant . 
to summar accus origin poster say someth forbidden bibl prove ok i.e . 
someth disproven true . 
he rather seem assert sinc bibl forbid prove use bibl ok . 
there differ prove whether someth proven disproven theori provabl field logic way actual prove disprov . 
the logic error must avoid fall convers someth proven fals . 
this seem error mani sola scriptura believ . 
i think thing proven one use scriptur alon prove someth either way infant baptism although evid seem favor .
