i dave davi wrote the deutero-canon book ad much later church 's histori . 
they spiritu qualiti rest scriptur . 
i believ church ad book guid spirit . 
and sort discuss ultim end . 
sorri i put foot mouth concern church 's histori . 
it correct say council hippo 393 list deuterocanon book among accept use church ratifi council carthag pope innoent i gelasius i 414 ad . 
yet eerdman 's histori church say at end fourth centuri view still differ regard extent canon number book acknowledg divin authorit . 
the jewish canon hebrew bibl univers receiv apocrypha ad greek version septuagint general way account book suitabl church read thus middl class canon strict apocryph pseudonym write . 
and just book great histor valu fill gap old testament new origin cessat propheci therefor regard inspir ever cite christ apostel in western church canon testament close end fourth centuri author jerom waver howev critic doubt principl tradit especi augustin firm follow alexandrian canon septuagint preponder tradit refer cathol epistl revel though place inclin consid old testament apocrypha deutero canon bear subordin author this histori goe say augustin attend council hippo carthag . 
it interest note howev follow footnot fourth session council trent . 
the footnot list various synod endors list canon book say the tridentin list decre first infal effectu promulg declar canon holi scriptur which lead one think rc canon offici trent . 
thus previous erron statement entir groundless . 
it also interest note council trent went uphold old latin vulgat edit scriptur authent . 
which i would suppos today 's cathol scholar wish council never said . 
also council made distinct deutero-canon canon booksin contrast eerdman 's statement fourth centuri view .
