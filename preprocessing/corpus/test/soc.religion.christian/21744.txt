but zero vers clear ' address issu n't mean also vers clear support case ? 
are sure want say zero vers clear address issu ? 
howev coupl seem though requir incred pervers interpret order seen condemn homosexu . 
the kind interpret i see incred pervers appli stori sodom blanket equat homosexu behavior rape .

you seem take view sin describ gen . 
19 fact sodomit want commit rape unfair stigmat homosexu associ sin rape . 
i see might reach conclus start conclus noth wrong homosexu re suppos start conclus 's circular reason . 
if god fact oppos homosexu intercours general probabl interpret he least offend sodomit ' blatant homosexu he intent commit rape . 
later i document i believ old testament portray god one despis homosexu intercours even partner consent adult .

the moder adequ discuss circular use porneia . 
the moder found propos circular regard church proper author determin kind marriag would legitim thus church 's refus recogn pervert marriag circular reason . 
my question howev noth church ordain new kind marriag argument someth straw man . 
in term origin question precis definitiontransl porneia n't realli import unless tri argu bibl n't realli condemn extramarit sex . 
i 'm sure moder tri . 
in case i think moder miss point . 
when jesus ask divorc he repli have read he creat begin made male femal said for caus man shall leav father mother shall cleav wife two shall becom one flesh ' ? 
consequ longer two one flesh .

anyway origin question whether translat porneia way condemn select kind extramarit sex question given heterosexu marriag union describ bibl divinely-ordain given biblic prohibit sex outsid marriag homosexu intercours sin ? 
of cours i see first need ask whether bibl realli condemn sex outsid marriag . 
you seem tri argu certain kind extramarit sex sin realli wrong i think agre paul some kind activ could name fornic theft covet revil drunken would well deserv condemn . 
we may may agre bound categori howev fact argu suggest matter clear paul excel rhetorician interest make clear leav matter rather spirit-l decis uncomfort living-with-other-read domin christian discuss all area . 
altern may definit term porneia rest paul 's day would call faq i.e .

perhap paul n't go detail porneia c 1600 year consid question dealt alreadi . 
perhap reason god 's apostl prophet devot great deal time defin distinct new testament sexual he intend signific chang sexual he alreadi establish law . 
i ll discuss law homosexu greater detail i want point new testament 's failur develop detail new standard sexual necessarili evid god care sexual conductespeci 1600 year put peopl death practic homosexu !

i glad ask . 
would agre god condemn homosexu intercours even among law mose would show god 's condemn homosexu act goe beyond ritual law ? 
if i show scriptur god punish homosexu behavior peopl law mose would agre god 's definit homosexu intercours abomin limit ritual law law ?
