as argument biblic issu 's attempt summar issu the common cite refer favor accept homosexu previous discuss john boswel christian social toler homosexu u chicago press 1980 . 
the argument pretti clear . 
there sever explicit law ot e.g . 
leviticus 2013 rom 1 paul seem pretti negat homosexu . 
beyond refer debat . 
some passag often cite subject probabl relev . 
e.g . 
sin inhabit sodom propos carri homosexu rape homosexu activ consent adult . 
there 's even question whether homosexu sinc entiti involv angel .

this probabl reason lot offer daughter better give daughter allow guest attack .

there 's jewish interpret tradit major sin abus guest . 
at rate 's debat homosexu rape wrong . 
i discuss leviticus law part set law christian consid bind . 
so unless nt justif found lev . 
alon would settl issu . 
the nt refer paul 's letter . 
a number refer paul list sin word fair vagu . 
boswel argu word occur list mean homosexu . 
here 's say the two greek word appear list i.e . 
i cor 69 i tim 110 malako arsenokoitai . 
unfortun entir clear word actual mean . 
malako basic mean soft varieti metaphor mean ethic write . 
boswel suggest wanton like equival . 
he also report unanim interpret church includ greek-speak christian passag refer masturb mean vanish 20th cent . 
practic come less frowned-upon . 
he cite refer late 1967 edit cathol encyclopedia identifi masturb . 
he translat arsenokotai male prostitut give evid none church father understood term refer homosexu general . 
a technic mean suggest earli latin translat would activ mode homosexu male prostitut view paul intend technic . 
for conserv view i consult gordon fee 's commentari i cor . 
he cite evid malako often meant effemin . 
howev boswel warn us greek cultur effemin necessarili synonym homosexu though may associ kind homosexu behavior . 
given boswel fee say taken togeth i suspect term simpli definit appli homosexu case n't general term homosexu . 
while fee argu boswel arsenokotai well end suggest translat seem essenti . 
the big problem word almost never use . 
paul 's write first occur . 
the fact word clear compos male fk unfortun n't quit tell us mean sinc n't tell us whether male subject object action . 
exampl compound word form either way given . 
in theori could refer rapist etc . 
it 's danger base mean pure etymolog ll conclud goodby religi express 's base god ye . 
howev sinc boswel fee niv seem agre homosexu male prostitut seem good guess . 
note translat miss strong vulgar term howev someth fee boswel agre attempt reproduc translat . 
in opinion strongest nt refer homosexu roman 1 . 
boswel point rom 1 speak homosexu someth happen peopl natur heterosexu result corrupt due worship fals god . 
one could argu simpli exampl homosexu worship fals god would also fall degrad perhap becom heterosexu . 
howev i find argument somewhat forc fact homosexu reader serious propos paul meant . 
howev i convinc rom 1 suffici creat law homosexu christian . 
what paul describ rom 1 homosexu among christian 's homosexu appear among idolat one part whole packag wicked . 
despit impress left impass rhetor i 'm sure paul believ pagan complet abandon heterosexu sex . 
given descript situat i rather assum heterosexu sex would also debas shameless . 
so yes i believ passag indic negat view homosexu . 
but fair shameless natur act reflect general spiritu state peopl specif featur homosexu . 
my overal view situat follow i think enough evid confid paul disapprov homosexu . 
rom 1 seem clear . 
while i cor 69 i tim 110 unambigu general condemn homosexu seem like word would come someon approv homosexu even consid accept case . 
on hand none passag contain explicit teach subject . 
rom 1 realli idolatri . 
it refer homosexu pass . 
the result situat peopl interpret passag light general approach scriptur . 
for look scriptur law issu surpris would consid passag nt endors ot prohibit . 
for whose approach bibl liber surpris regard paul 's negat view homosexu someth took jewish upbring without serious reexamin light gospel . 
as reader group know assumpt behind approach radic differ peopl tend foam mouth see oppos view describ . 
there 's lot i moder situat . 
a number discuss past center around sort detail exegesi text describ . 
howev fact i 'm convinc defend homosexu actual base belief analys . 
the real issu seem rest question whether paul 's judgement appli modern homosexu . 
one common made claim paul simpli never face kind question tri deal . 
he encount homosexu context peopl would probabl agre wrong . 
he never face experi christian tri act straight fail never face christian tri defin christian homosexu fit general christian ideal fidel see sexual mirror relationship god man . 
it unfair take paul 's judgement homosexu among idolat use make judgement question . 
anoth follow in paul 's time homosexu associ number thing christian would find accept . 
it part templ prostitut . 
among privat citizen often occur adult children free peopl slave . 
i 'm posit say alway reason think . 
the ancient distinguish activ passiv partner . 
it consid disgrac free adult act passiv partner . 
this reason activ mode homosexu prostitut would consid disgrac . 
his custom would peopl enjoy passiv role . 
this support idea would tend engag two free adult male least without degre scandal . 
clear christian homosexu would condon sex children slave other posit fulli respons partner . 
howev fee 's commentari i cor cite exampl ancient literatur homosexu relationship seem involv free adult reason symmetr way . 
thus consider paragraph n't push far . 
homosexu may discredit jew associ sure must case prostitut involv slave children . 
some peopl argu aid judgement homosexu . 
i 'd like point aid transmit promiscu sex homosexu heterosexu . 
someon homosexu relationship meet christian criteria marriag risk aid . 
note good reason paul 's general approach doubt would conced homosexu fulli equal altern apart specif statement homosexu . 
i believ use genesi stori would lead regard heterosexu marriag god ordain . 
howev way paul deal pastor question provid warn quick deal issu legal . 
i claim question counsel homosexu christian entir theolog issu also pastor one . 
paul 's tendenc see issu eat meat celebr holiday uncompromis principl pastor issu look care good peopl involv avoid insist perfect would person damag . 
for exampl paul clear believ accept eat meat want us avoid push peopl action person qualm . 
for anoth exampl paul obvious would prefer see peopl least circumst remain unmarri . 
yet unabl certain would rather see marri state might tempt fornic . 
i believ one could take view like even accept view paul express rom 1 . 
one may believ homosexu god intend occur result sin still conclud time live . 
note creation stori work enter human life result sin . 
this n't mean christian stop work save . 
the question whether believ homosexu sin whether believ 's misfortun broad sens due human sin . 
if re will consid latter approach becom pastor judgement whether damag caus find way live tri cure . 
the danger tri cure attempt often fail end damag rang psycholog damag suicid well broken marriag attempt live heterosexu fail . 
this go depend upon one 's assess inher natur homosexu . 
if believ serious wrong may will run high risk serious damag get rid . 
clear general suggest peopl live tendenc steal drug addict even though attempt cure condit also difficult . 
howev condit intrins damag way obvious homosexu . 
mani problem associ homosexu actual problem promiscu homosexu . 
this includ aid . 
i take grant sort homosexu relationship christian would consid allow would equival christian heterosexu relationship . 
in cours discuss last decad ve heard lot person testimoni fellow christian situat . 
i ve also seen summari various research result various effort convers . 
asid presbyterian report mention 's faq summar reader ' report question . 
the evid long-term success chang orient rare enough par heal miracl . 
the danger advis christian depend upon chang clear when convers n't happen almost alway peopl often left despair feel exclud church noth say requir life-long celibaci . 
paul recogn though differ context demand practic peopl i think histori cleric celibaci strong reinforc judgement . 
the practic result homosexu end gay sex club rest sordid side homosexu . 
mayb homosexu n't god 's origin ideal i well imagin paul prefer see peopl long-term commit christian relationship promiscu . 
as work genesi suggest n't part god 's origin ideal either i think relationship still vehicl peopl share god 's love . 
there 's issu biblic interpret under discuss . 
the issu cultur relativ . 
that paul say someth wrong taken etern statement thing wrong specif situat cultur time ? 
conserv christian general insist take prohibit absolut sinc otherwis bibl becom subject stop us consid everyth relat ? 
when look issu 's worth note one complet reject concept cultur relativ .

when christian homosexu say relationship differ greek homosexu paul would familiar exact kind argument made judici oath tax collector . 
until fair recent christian prohibit take interest mani christian regard slaveri divin endors . 
inde slaveri one common metaphor relationship god human be christian often call servant slave god . 
i tri say everyth bibl cultur relat . 
rather i 'm tri say thing therefor enough say someth appear bibl end discuss . 
we need look whether action re talk moral implic one bibl talk . 
if christian want argu reason think prohibit homosexu still bind i 'm will listen . 
those claim question n't need look kid unless part small minor realli obey rule list . 
one thing worri great emot issu creat . 
when consid weak biblic evid law leviticus passag rom whose subject matter realli idolatri rather homosexu coupl list whose word ambigu amount concern rais among christian seem rather proport . 
this suggest peopl reason simpli biblic involv . 
this true side clear homosexu christian strong motiv find way discredit biblic argument conserv christian find biblic argument . 
but i ca n't help feel bibl use side way justifi attitud come sourc . 
this danger situat christian . 
on side issu i would like note problem i pro-homosexu posit common present . 
one common argument homosexu biolog determin . 
i.e . 
god made homosexu i choic . 
i think god made homosexu fine view peopl alreadi believ ground homosexu accept . 
but i n't see argument accept .
