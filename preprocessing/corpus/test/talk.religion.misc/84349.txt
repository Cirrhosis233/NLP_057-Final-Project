i saw one theist net talk absurd one say n't believ god sure . 
the problem argument assum burden proof lie atheist . 
wrong ! 
in philosophi one make posit argument must give reason believ negat . 
if i make statement elv exist would prove posit assert person say elv n't exist . 
if negat case prove elv n't exist would omnisci know everi inch univers . 
the appli god . 
give reason theist make case . 
i think address wrong issu . 
the situat like see elv . 
this establish fact sinc touch etc . 
then one us say elv alway us . 
the say time elv . 
which posit argument ?
