is zeno 's paradox ? 
no . 
zeno 's paradox resolv show integr infinit seri decreas term sum finit result . 
noth get black hole escap veloc speed light . 
i n't know time dialat prevent matter spiral get event horizon . 
can any- one explain matter get . 
well suppos probe emit radiat constant frequenc sent toward black hole . 
as got closer event horizon red shift would keep increas . 
the period would get longer longer would never stop . 
an observ would observ probe actual reach event horizon . 
the detect energi probe would keep decreas would n't vanish . 
exp-t never quit reach zero . 
i guess probabl n't make thing clear hope get general idea mayb .
