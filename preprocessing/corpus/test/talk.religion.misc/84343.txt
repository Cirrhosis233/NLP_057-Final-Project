there actual talk.abort relat comment believ ... 
specif i 'd like know relativ conclud two peopl grotesqu disagre . 
is both right b one wrong sometim though perhap rare pretti good idea c one wrong never inform make best guess realli must make decis . 
the idea right moral judgement meaningless impli whether peac better war e.g . 
meaningless question need discuss correct answer e someth els . 
a short posit assert would nice . 
from whose point view would like know relativ conclud ? 
one peopl involv argument third person observ arguer ? 
i ve come respond anoth post penni drop . 
but would clarifi would answer point view disinterest observ perhap observ like posit a posit b a b disagre futur conclus bind time . 
well observ x like a 's posit b 's agre a b make appropri observ infer regard situat i would expect conclud right answer . 
hope would factor would allow make judgement regard answer accept . 
if hand disagre principl either a b i suspect would make decis favour one . 
it unfortun case moral argument answer perspect . 
for instanc i complet unabl come conclus regard whether abort allow perspect . 
in ideal world live thing would right life ideal world women would absolut right like bodi . 
clear way resolv favour principl . 
therefor i agre compromis solut allow abort certain time concept decid time base various sometim ill-defin criteria . 
this also sensibl move i think let peopl make decis within reason . 
and 's worth i reason happi current uk abort law . 
similar situat 's left yugoslavia horribl mess i realli ca n't see way sort conclus . 
there i n't even know enough imagin sort compromis one might manag .
